# Introduction
 
Validating and assessing the uncertainy of a model is just as, if not more important, than generating the model itself. Validation quantifies the model's ability to explain variance in the data while uncertainty quantifies the confidence of model prediction. Uncertainty and validation assessments enable the end user to better understand model error, the nature and distribution of the input data, and the overall accuracy and spatial applicability of the model. Within a soil model, there are several sources of error:  

- Measurement errors
- Interpretation errors
- Digitization errors
- Classification errors
- Generalization errors
- Interpolation errors

Errors are simply the difference between reality and our representation of reality. Assessing the data structure with simple statistical measures such as mean, median and mode can be useful for understanding the central tendency of the data, but more complicated calculations are needed to get at dispersion or the variation of a property within a population to further assess error and uncertainty (Zar, 1999).

**Measure of Dispersion**
  - Range: The difference between the highest and lowest values measured or observed. Not always reliable because it can include outliers, error, or misclassified data. 
  - Quantiles: These refer to 25% increments in the rank of observations. Typically, the 25th and 75th quantiles are used to represent the spread of the most typical values around the central tendency.

**Measure of Variation**
  * Variance: The deviation of from the mean is calculated as sum of squares (SS) to use absolute deviation (eliminate any distinction between negative and positive correlation). $variance (sample) = \frac{SS}{n-1}$
  
  * $SS = \sum{(X - x)^2}$
   
  * Standard deviation: Used to return variance to the original units $sd = \sqrt{\frac{SS}{n-1}}$
  
  * Coefficient of variation: Scale standard deviation with mean so that multiple properties can be compared $CV = \frac{SD}{x}$


## Exercise

-Create an example dataset and evaluate dispersion.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# set random seed, so that we all get the same results
set.seed(123)

# create a sample set with 10 values between 20 - 60
d1 <- data.frame(
  soil = "alpha",
  depth = sample(20:60, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
  )

quantile(d1$depth)

# example box plot
ggplot(d1, aes(x = soil, y = depth)) + geom_boxplot()
```
    
**Measures of certainty**

- Standard Error: represents the variance of the mean that would be found with repeated sampling. Estimated by dividing standard deviation by the square root of n. The concept of standard error is important for hypothesis testing.
- Confidence interval: Interval in which you are confident that a given percentage (known as the confidence limit 95, 80, 75%) of the population lie. If a normal distribution is assumed, for a 95% confidence interval, it can be estimated that the value is 95% likely to fall between as SD * 1.96 +/- mean.    
  
## Exercise 

- Calculate Standard Error
- Calculate Condfidence interval (95%)
- Resample 10 times, each time calculate mean and variance.


```{r}
# set random seed, so that we all get the same results
set.seed(123)

# simulate a dataset with two soil names with depth values from 20 - 60 (some values occur more than once)
d2 <- data.frame(
  soil = "beta",
  depth = sample(20:60, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
  )

quantile(d2$depth)

# combine d1 and d2
d3 <- rbind(d1, d2)

# examine box plots
ggplot(d3, aes(x = soil, y = depth)) + geom_boxplot()

# calculate the mean of depth
m <- mean(d2$depth)
 
# subtract mean from each value and square (i.e. residuals)
d2$S <- (d2$depth - m)^2
 
#calculate overall sum of squares
SS <- sum(d2$S)
 
#calculate sample variance (length gives us the total number of sample/observations)
SS / (length(d2$depth) - 1)
```

Note the differences in range and variance calculated for Depth in both examples (10 samples vs. 100)

```{r}
aggregate(depth ~ soil, data = d3, quantile)
aggregate(depth ~ soil, data = d3, var)
```

Now Compare Standard Error (standard deviation / square root of n)

```{r}
SE <- function(x) sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))

aggregate(depth ~ soil, data = d3, SE)
```

Why are the standard errors different?


# Theory of Uncertainty
  
At it's most basic level, uncertainty is simply a lack of certainty. In soil survey, uncertainty encompasses both of these aspects:

1. you've gathered multiple observations and you need to describe them in relation to one another, and 
2. you must predict a property or characteristic at unobserved locations. 

It is difficult to quantify the knowledge we have about data and information uncertainty. While we may have good data of the accuracy of our GPS, how likely are we to include that in our estimates of model error? How important is it? In other disciplines, they spend a lot of time quantifying and tracking measurement error. In soil science, we tend to treat measurement as having an exact known location and value. Given the unknowns in mapping and predicting soil properties, this is a reasonable treatment of relatively small levels of error.

When using secondary information as data (or data that is actually a prior prediction or result of a model, including soil components), considering incorporated error can be crucial. One way to deal with this is through resampling an alternate way is to through error propagation theory. The most common way to deal with this in soil survey and digital soil mapping is to assess error through model validation.
	
**Explanatory vs. Predictive Modelling**

While explanatory and predictive modeling can use the same types of models, data and even questions, the errors and uncertainty are important for different reasons

**Explanatory or Descriptive** - data are collected and analyzed in order to test causal hypothesis and observe correlations and relationships between data element. Often used at the beginning phases of soil-landscape exploration. How does the soil relate to each of the soil forming factors?

**Predictive** - applying a model or algorithm to data for the purpose of making a prediction (in new or unknown locations) (Shueli, 2010).
  
  
# Resampling to Estimate Uncertainty
  
When calculating many basic statistical parameters, the assumption is that the data is parametric. That implies that the data is continuous (ratio or interval) and normally distributed. This is rarely the case with soil data. Soil properties are often not normally distributed (you cannot have less that 0% organic matter, for instance) and often we are trying to predict soil taxa or other nominal classes. 

Resampling is a general term that defines any procedure to repeatedly draw samples form a given dataset. You are essentially pretending to collect a series of separate samples from your sample set then calculating a statistic on that sample. Resampling techniques can be used on known and unknown data distributions for uncertainty estimation and validation (Good, 2001).  

```{r}
# this bootstrap is estimating the uncertainty associated with the variance of d2$depth
# an example of getting a confidence interval through bootstrapping (no assumption of a normal distribution)

# abbreviate our data to simply the commands
d <- d2$depth
n <- length(d)

# set number of iterations
N <- 50

# create a data frame to store the results
boot_stats <- data.frame(
  vars = numeric(N),
  means = numeric(N)
  )

for (i in 1:N){ # for each instance (i) in the set from 1 to N (50 in this case)
  boot.sample = sample(d, n, replace = TRUE) #create a new variable dB from each bootstrap sample of d
  boot_stats$means[i] = mean(boot.sample)
  boot_stats$vars[i] = var(boot.sample)
  }

quantile(boot_stats$vars)

stripchart(boot_stats$vars)

# Traditional Approach
ci <- c(
  # lower 5th
  l = mean(d) - 1.96 * sd(d) / sqrt(n),
  # upper 95th
  u = mean(d) + 1.96 * sd(d) / sqrt(n)
  )

# Compare Bootstrap to Confidence Interval
quantile(boot_stats$means, c(0.05, 0.95))

ci
```


# Validation
  
Validation refers to the process and the result of a process where the validity of a model is tested. That is, how well does the model represent reality? There are varying degrees of formality and thoroughness that can be used in validation. While multiple stages of the modeling process can be validated, usually it's the output of the model that is investigated and reported. You can group initial validation into three broad groups: Expert evaluation, Theoretical Analysis and Prediction Accuracy.  

**Expert Evaluation:**  In this case, the model output is inspected by an expert user. The first evaluator will be you (the developer), but ideally an outside expert will be utilized. This is often a step in an iterative process. Evaluate the model output, does it make sense, do you see things that need to be improved? Then make changes to the model to improve the output.  

**Theoretical Analysis:** compare the results of the model to what is theoretically possible. In systems modeling, this might include diagnostics statistics including residual analysis, cross-correlation of variables and outputs, sensitivity analysis and model analysis such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This can also include simple comparison of output to known possible values. This is especially important for linear regression where the slope of the model is assumed to be steady no matter the values of the dependent variables.  

**Prediction Accuracy:**  The correctness of the parameter being predicted by the model (soil taxa, property etc.).  Ideally this is done with an independent set of data. 

**Error Metrics**

- Numerical
    - Correlation (r2)
    - Scatter plots (visual inspection)
    - Mean Error (ME) = mean(predicted - actual)
    - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = sqrt((mean(predicted - actual)^2))
- Categorical
    - Confusion (error) matrix
    - Types of Accuracy
        - Overall Acuraccy - proportion of observations that were correctly classified, to all classes
        - Precision (e.g. user's Accuracy, errors of commision (Type II) - proportion of observations that were correctly classifed, to an individual class
        - Sensitivity (e.g. producer's accuracy, errors of omission (Type I)) - proportion of predictions that were correctly classified, to an individual class
        
In soil science, we typically use the term model validation to refer to a statistical analysis that assesses how well a model will predict at an unknown location. A complete model should have a formal statistical evaluation that can be reported and stored as model and output meta-data. That is the portion of validation we will focus. For this discussion, validation can be thought of as an assessment of prediction error and variance.

**Three types of validation used in the course**

- Apparent - Performance on sample used to develop model
- Internal - Performance on population underlying the sample
- External - Performance on related (similar/adjacent) but independent population


# Apparent Validation
  
In this exploratory and explanatory phase you are looking for relationships that can be used later for predictive purposes.

- Use Goodness of fit tests on all the data in your sample
    - Correlation (R2, rho, etc.)
    - P-values (test questions about individual or combinations of variables)
- Analyze Residuals (distribution of model errors) to diagnose modeling problems. One or more of these issues indicate that one or more important variables was omitted from the model or that an incorrect functional form was used (linear when the function should be non-linear)
    - Heteroscedasticity
    - Normality
    - Spatial distribution (autocorrelation)

# Inherent Validation 

## Split-sample - A single partition of the data into a learning and a calibration set.

- Achieve an independent validation by partitioning the samples into calibration or training and validation datasets (70% of the samples available are recommended for calibration)
    - Build model on calibration (training) dataset
    - Test model on validation (test) dataset
    - Report accuracy on the validation dataset
- This method is relatively simple (conceptually and computationally). Results depend on having an adequate sample size to both develop and test the model.

## Cross-validation - Alternate development and validation

**Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**

- One observation is used for testing and all others are used to develop model
- Repeat n (total number of observations) times
- Average error over n
- The mean of the accuracy is the expected accuracy of the model (this assumes that new data is from the same population) (Efron, 1983)

**k-fold Cross-Validation (k-fold) CV**

- Randomly divide observations into calibration and validation sets.
- Repeat k times, each time one k group is used for error estimates
- Average error of k
- Less computationally intensive than LOOCV, but it is more robust and can be done with smaller sample sizes than a simple split.
- Several R packages have tools to cross-validate predictions, including: `DAAG` and `boot` for `lm()` and `glm()` objects, `caret`, `rms`,

### Linear model example

# Load and modify data
load(file = "C:/workspace/github/stats_for_soil_survey/trunk/data/ch7_data.Rdata")
train_lm <- data
train_lm <- subset(train_lm, frags > 0 & frags < 100)

# Custom logit and inverse logit function
logit <- function(x) log(x / (1 - x)) # logit transform
ilogit <- function(x) exp(x) / (1 + exp(x)) # inverse logit 

# Transform
train_lm$fragst <- logit(train_lm$frags / 100)

# Subset
train_lm <- subset(train_lm, select = c(pc_2, pc_1, temp, twi, precipsum, fragst))

# Create linear model
fragst_lm <- lm(fragst ~ pc_2 + pc_1 + temp + twi + precipsum, data = train_lm)

# Create folds
folds <- createFolds(train_lm$fragst, k = 10)

# Cross validate
lm_cv <- lapply(folds, function(x) {
  train   = train_lm[-x,]
  test    = train_lm[x,]
  model   = lm(fragst ~ ., data = train)
  actual  = ilogit(test$fragst) * 100
  predict = ilogit(predict(model, test)) * 100
  RMSE    = sqrt(mean((actual - predict)^2, na.rm = TRUE))
  R2      = cor(actual, predict, use = "pairwise")^2
  return(c(RMSE = RMSE, R2 = R2))
  }
  )

# Convert to a data.frame
lm_cv <- do.call(rbind, lm_cv)


### Random forest example
library(randomForest)

# Modify data
train_rf <- data
train_rf <- subset(train_rf, frags > 0 & frags < 100, 
                 select = - c(pedon_id, taxonname, x_std, y_std, describer2, landform.string,
                              argillic.horizon, landform, tax_subgroup, cluster2, cluster_mast,
                              aspect, mast, gsi, ndvi, sw)
                 )

# Create folds
folds2 <- createFolds(train_rf$frags, k = 10)

# # Cross validate
# rf_cv <- lapply(folds2, function(x) {
#   train   = train_rf[-x,]
#   test    = train_rf[x,]
#   model   = randomForest(frags ~ ., data = train, na.action = na.exclude)
#   actual  = test$frags
#   predict = predict(model, test)
#   RMSE    = sqrt(mean((actual - predict)^2, na.rm = TRUE))
#   R2      = cor(actual, predict, use = "pairwise")^2
#   return(c(RMSE = RMSE, R2 = R2))
#   }
#   )
# 
# save(rf_cv, file = "temp.RData")
load("C:/workspace/temp.RData")

# Convert to a data.frame
rf_cv <- do.call(rbind, rf_cv)

# Summarize results
summary(lm_cv)
summary(rf_cv)
```

  
## Subsample (Resampling or sample simulation)

In this method, the 'leave-out' method can be random (Bootstrap) or observation selection can use a more sophisticated method to select observations to represent the population including Monte Carlo (Molarino, 2005) and .632+bootstrap of Efron & Tibshirani (1997). The details of those aren't important, except to know that they can give you a better idea of the robustness of your model.

- As with resampling for uncertainty estimation, observations are repeatedly sampled
    - Select a number of samples (Randomly or from known distribution).
    - Develop the model
    - Estimate model accuracy on unselected samples
    - Repeat the process (with independent sample) a large number of times, 500 - 5,000. 
    - The expected model accuracy is then the mean of the estimates. 

	
**NOTE:** The BEST model should not be assumed to be the one that makes the 'truest' predictions. Beware of overfitting. When a model is overfit, it predicts due to very specific "quirks" in the calibration data set and not due to explanatory relationships that will apply to validation and independent datasets. One strategy to avoid this situation is to build models with as few variables as possible. Parsimonious models (those that use the least amount of information possible to obtain the same result or convey the same meaning) often have higher predicative validity. The use of metrics such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) can be helpful for balancing error and parameter minimization.


## External Validation  

In this case, an independent dataset is used as the test case.  

- Independent observations predicted with model
- Errors (ME, RMSE) calculated on predicted vs. actual
- Some exploratory analysis can be helpful to diagnose and explain model performance.
  
The use of validation will be demonstrated as part of each modeling section. The size of the dataset used, understanding of the variables involved and the nature of the statistical models and algorithms used all influence which validation techniques are most convienent and appropriate.
