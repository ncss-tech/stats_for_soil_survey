## Course Objectives

- Develop solutions to investigate soil survey correlation problems and update activities
- Evaluate investigations for interpretive results and determine how to proceed
- Summarize data for populations in NASIS
- Analyze spatial data to investigate soil-landscape relationships
- Help to pursue the question "why" 

---

## Why is this training needed?

- Long standing goal of the Soil Science Division to have a course in statistics [@mausbach2003]
- Opportunities to learn these techniques are limited, especially at the undergraduate level [@hennemann2004]
- Consistent methodology (data analysis, data population, sampling design, etc.)
- There is continually a greater need to use these techniques:
    - Mapping of lands at high production rates [@macmillan2007; @kempen2012; @brevik2016]
    - Ecological Sites [@maynard2019]
    - Soil survey refinement (disaggregation) [@chaney2016; @ramcharan2018]

## Why is course organized this way?

- Our best judgement for assembling into **24** hours what could be **6** University level courses
- Mixture of slides and script enabled web pages is new for NRCS
- The web content is a long-term investment and should serve as a permanent reference
- Feel free to provide guidance for improving the class for future offerings

## What is R? - Open Source Project

1. a software environment: statistics, graphics, programming, calculator, GIS, etc...

2. a language: vocabulary to explore, summarize, and model data

## What is R? - "One Tool""

![*ODBC and GDAL link R to nearly all possible formats/interfaces*](static-figures/triangle.png){ width=50% }


---


## Why should I use R? - 3 Reasons!

1. Cost. R is free! ["Free as in free speech, not free beer"!](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

2. [Reproducible Research](http://christophergandrud.github.io/RepResR-RStudio/) (*self-documenting, repeatable*)
    + repeatable: 
        + code + output in a single document *('I want the right answer, not a quick answer' - Paul Finnell)*
        + easier the next time ([humorous example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=s3JldKoA0zw))
        + numerous Excel horror stories of scientific studies gone wrong exist ([TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXKbkpilQME))
    + scalable: applicable to small or large problems

3. R in a Community
    + [Numerous Discipline Specific R Groups](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
    + [Numerous Local R User Groups (including R-Ladies Groups)](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html#north-america)
    + [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

4. Learning Resources *(quantity and quality)*
    + [R books](https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html)
    + [(Free Online) R Books](https://bookdown.org/)

5.  R is 'becoming' the new norm (paradigm shift?). "If we don't accept these challenges, other who are less qualified will; and soil scientists will be displaced by apathy." [@arnold1991]

## What can R do? - Packages
* Base R (*functionality is extended through packages*)
    + basic summaries of quantitative or qualitative data
    + data exploration via graphics
    + [GIS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) data processing and analysis

* Soil Science R Packages
    + [aqp](https://github.com/ncss-tech/aqp) - visualization, aggregation, classification
    + [soilDB](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB) - access to commonly used soil databases
    + [soilReports](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilReports) - handful of report templates
    + [soiltexture](http://soiltexture.r-forge.r-project.org/) - textural triangles

* [Ecology](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Environmetrics.html) R packages
    + [vegan](http://vegan.r-forge.r-project.org/) - ordination, diversity analysis, etc...
    + [dismo](http://rspatial.org/sdm/) -  species distribution modeling

1. Can you think of a situation where an existing hypothesis or conventional wisdom was not repeatable?
