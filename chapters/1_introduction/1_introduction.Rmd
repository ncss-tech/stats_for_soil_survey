## 1.0  Introduction

R is a free, open-source software and programming language developed in 1995 at the University of Auckland. R is capable of executing simple and complex mathematical, statistical, and graphical functions [(Ikaha and Gentleman, 1996)](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-paper.pdf).  It is a dialect of the S language and is case sensitive. The R interface allows you to execute functions using a command prompt (>). To date, R has become popular amongst soil scientists and ecologists for exploring data, modeling soil and plant relationships, generating raster-based model predictions, and developing new R functions.  

R and RStudio have been installed on all computers on which NASIS is installed. R and RStudio are typically updated and CCE approved once a year. The versions on USDA machines may be one to three releases behind the latest version available for public download. Having an outdated version of R  rarely creates a problem, although warnings may appear.  

Tips for using R:  

- R is command-line driven. It requires you to type or copy-and-paste commands after a command prompt (>) that appears when you open R. After typing a command in the R console and pressing **Enter** on your keyboard, the command will run. If your command is not complete, R issues a continuation prompt (signified by a plus sign: `+`). 

- R has a built-in editor where you can edit and select code to run. Some people, however, find it easier to use Notepad. 

- R is case sensitive. Make sure your spelling and capitalization are correct!  
 
- Commands in R are also called functions. The basic format of a function in R is: `function.name(argument, options)`.  
 
- The up arrow (^) on your keyboard can be used to bring up previous commands that you've typed in the R console. 
 
- The `$` symbol is used to select a particular column within the dataset, e.g., `dataset$column`.

- Any text that you do not want R to act on (such as instructions, information, notes or comments) needs to be preceded by the `#` symbol (a.k.a. hashtag, comment, pound, or number symbol).  R ignores the remainder of the script line following `#`. For example:  
 
`plot(x ~ y) # This text will not affect the plot function because of the comment`


## 1.1  R Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 
Navigate to R (in the start and program menus) and open the latest version of R (64 bit, version 3.2.2 or later). When you first open R, the R console window below appears:  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig1_rgui.jpg)  

The RGui contains 3 main windows: R console, R editor, and R graphics:  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig2_rgui.jpg)  

To run a command in R, you type the command after the command prompt `>` in the R Console window and press the **Enter** key. You can edit command text in R Editor, and you can also highlight a command, right-click, and select **Run** for the command. 

The R Graphics window is displayed only if you run the `plot()` function.  

Commands in R can range from simple mathematical equations to complex statistical functions and models. As an example of simple math, if you type:  `9 * 8 + 6 - 1` in R and press **Enter**, R will act as a calculator and return the answer `77`.  

## 1.2  Data Management in R  

Before working in R, create a working directory (a folder) to hold all of your R files; for example, "C:\workspace". This directory is where your input datasets are stored and your R files are located. It also serves as the default storage for plots or objects exported from R. 

At the beginning of each R session, whether you are using R or Rstudio, you want to set your working directory. Change the working directory in R to the new folder you set up using the following command:   

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/workspace")

#R uses / instead of \ for file paths
```

To check the file path of the current working directory (which should now be "C:\workspace"), type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

The working directory can also be set or changed by clicking on **File** > **Change dir** from the menu bar. The working directory allows you to import data into R with just a file name, not an entire folder path and file name. It is also the default folder for when you save data to or export data out of R. Every time you start an R session, you should set your working directory. 

### 1.2.1 Importing Data
After your working directory is set, you can import data from .txt, .csv, etc. One basic command for importing data into R is `read.csv()`. The command is followed by the file name and then some optional instructions for how to read the file.    

First, create an example file by copying the contents below, starting with "location" and ending with "24." Paste the content into Notepad and save the file as sand_example.txt in the C:\workspace folder.  

location,landuse,horizon,depth,sand  
city,crop,A,14,19  
city,crop,B,25,21  
city,pasture,A,10,23  
city,pasture,B,27,34  
city,range,A,15,22  
city,range,B,23,23  
farm,crop,A,12,31  
farm,crop,B,31,35  
farm,pasture,A,17,30  
farm,pasture,B,26,36  
farm,range,A,15,25  
farm,range,B,24,29  
west,crop,A,13,27  
west,crop,B,29,25  
west,pasture,A,11,21  
west,pasture,B,31,26  
west,range,A,14,23  
west,range,B,24,24  

The file sand_example.txt can then be imported into R by typing:  

```{r}
sand<- read.csv("C:/workspace/sand_example.txt", header=TRUE, sep=",") 

#since you've specified your working directory, you could also use: sand<-read.csv("sand_example.txt")

#use the read.table() function to import other types of table formatted files
```

Other arguments are available for use with `read.csv()`. A quick way to find out what arguments are available for a given command is to type `help(command)`. In this example, you would type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(read.csv) # or
?read.csv
```

These help commands bring up a webpage that describes all of the possible arguments for a command. The help pages also typically provide examples. You should also notice by reading the help page for `read.csv()` that it is just one of several functions for reading text files.

### 1.2.2 Exporting Data

To export data from R, use the command `write.csv`. Since we have already set our working directory, R automatically saves our file into the working directory.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(sand, file = "sand_example2.csv")

#for other output file types, use the write.table() function
``` 

### 1.2.3 Viewing Data

Once the file is imported, it is imperative that you check to ensure that R correctly imported your data. Make sure numerical data are correctly imported as numerical, that your column headings are kept as headings, etc. Commands that you can use to view your data in R include `str()`, `names()`, and `head()`. The command `str()` shows the structure of the data object,  `names()` shows the column names (i.e. headers) of your data, and `head` prints the first 6 lines of data. You can also enter the name of the table next to the command prompt to print the entire table; however, avoid doing this if your table is large. Instead, for large tables try `View(sand)`, which opens the dataset in a separate window.   

Enter the following commands to view your dataset in R:  
```{r}
str(sand)
names(sand)
head(sand)

ls()
``` 

A data object is anything you've created or imported and assigned a name to in R. The `ls()` command allows you to see what data objects are in your R session. In the figure above, you see that sand is the only data object returned. If you wanted to delete all data objects from your R session, you would type: `rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))`

The `ls()` and `rm()` functions are also available in the RGui under the menu bar heading Misc.

## 1.3  Saving R Files  

In R, you can save several types of files to keep track of the work you do. The file types include workspace, script, history, and graphics. It is important to save often because R, like other software, may crash periodically. Such problems are especially likely when working with large files. Saving your work in R can be done via the command line or file menu selection.  

### 1.3.1 Workspace (.Rdata)  

The R workspace consists of all the data objects you've created or loaded during your R session. When you quit R by either typing `q()` or exiting out of the application window, R prompts you to save your workspace. If you choose yes, R saves a file named .RData to your working directory. The next time you open R and link to that working directory, all of your data objects will be available in R and all of the commands that you've typed will be accessible by using the up-arrow and down-arrow keys on your keyboard. You can also save or load your workspace at any time during your R session by clicking on File tab on the menu bar.   

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig11_rgui.jpg)  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig12_rgui.jpg)    

The R command for saving your workspace is:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
save.image(file="workspace.RData")
```

### 1.3.2 R script (.R)  

An R script is simply a text file of R commands that you've typed. 

You may want to save your scripts (whether they were written in R Editor or an ancillary program like Notepad) so that you can reference them in the future, edit them as needed, and keep track of what you've done. In order to save R scripts in the RGui, make sure the R Editor window is active and go to **File > Save as** on the menu bar. Save scripts with the .R extension. R assumes that script files are saved with only that extension. If you are using another text editor, you won't need to worry about saving your scripts in R. You can always copy and paste them in to the R Console or R Editor from your text editor.  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig13_rgui.jpg)  

To open an R script, go to File > Open script.  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig14_rgui.jpg)  

### 1.3.3 R history (.Rhistory) 

An R history file is a copy of all your key strokes. You can think of it as brute force way of saving your work. It can be useful if you didn't document all your steps in an R script file. Like an R file, an Rhistory file is simply a text file that lists all of the commands that you've executed. It does not keep a record of the results. To load or save your R history from the menu bar select: **File > Load History** or **File > Save History.** If you load an Rhistory file, your previous commands will again become available with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys.

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig15_rgui.jpg) 

You can also use the command line to load or save your history:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
savehistory(file = "sand.Rhistory")  
loadhistory(file = "sand.Rhistory")  
history(max.show=Inf) #displays all previous commands
```

### 1.3.4 R Graphics   

Graphic outputs can be saved in various formats: 
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
test <- data.frame(Function = c('pdf("graphic.pdf")', 'win.metafile("graphic.wmf")', 'png("graph.png")', 'jpeg("graph.jpg")', 'bmp("graph.bmp")', 'postscript("graph.ps")'), Output = c("pdf file", "window metafile", "png file", "jpeg file", "bmp file", "postscript file"))
kable(test)
```

To save a graphic: (1) Click in the Graphics Device window to bring it to focus, (2) click on **File > Save as** from the menu bar, and (3) save as desired image format.  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig18_rgui.jpg)  

The R command for saving a graphic is:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
jpeg(file = "sand.jpeg")
plot(sand$sand)
dev.off()
```

The first line of this command creates a blank file named sand with a JPEG extension.  The second line plots the data object that you want to create a graphic of (here it is conveniently the same name as the jpeg file we are creating). The third line closes the graphics device.  

## 1.4 Installing and Loading Packages

Packages are collections of well-defined and referenced code that run specific functions. They commonly include example data that can be used to deomonstrate those functions. Although R comes with standard, basic statistical functions, most of our work requires additional packages.

To use a package, you must install it and then load it. These steps can be done at the command line or using the RGui. Examples of both are provided below. R packages only need to be installed once (until R is upgraded or re-installed). Every time you start a new R session, however, you need to load every package that you intend to use in that session.  

###1.4.1 Installing Packages

When the R Console window is active in the RGui, you can navigate to the **Packages** drop-down menu on the menu bar. (Click on the Console window if it is not currently active.) You will see options to set your CRAN mirror and to load, install, and update packages. You can select more than one package to install at a time by holding down the Ctrl key. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is a collection of sites that carry identical material for R. Select the location closest to you.    

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig10_rgui.jpg)  

To find out what packages are installed on your computer, use the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library() #or
installed.packages()

``` 

Prior to installing a package, you will need to indicate which CRAN mirror site you would like to download from. Select the site closest to your physical location.

The maps package allows us to create nice base maps in R. The following command shows how to install this package if you do not have currently have it downloaded:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("maps", dep=TRUE) #dep=TRUE will install all packages that "maps" depends on to work correctly
``` 

###1.4.2 Loading Packages

Once a package is installed, it must be loaded into the R session to be used. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(maps)
```

You can also install and load packages using the *Packages* drop-down menu. Documentation about the maps package is available from the help functions in R. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(package = "maps")
``` 

This help command sends you to a webpage. Scroll down and select the link "map." This link brings up a webpage that has instructions on how to use the map function in R. 

The basic usage of the map function is: map(database, regions). 
 
The "database" argument specifies a character string naming a geographical database, or a list of x, y, and names obtained from a previous call to map. The string choices include a world map, three USA databases (usa, state, county), and more (see the package index). The location of the map databases may be overridden by setting the R_MAP_DATA_DIR environment variable. See world for further details. 

The "regions" option specifies a character vector that names the polygons to draw. Each database is composed of a collection of polygons, and each polygon has a unique name. When a region is composed of more than one polygon, the individual polygons have the name of the region, followed by a colon and a qualifier, as in michigan:north and michigan:south. Each element of regions is matched against the polygon names in the database and, according to exact matching, a subset is selected for drawing. The default selects all polygons in the database.  

Next we can call the `map` function from the maps package:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map("usa")
map("state")
``` 

When the region is left out, it defaults to showing all regions. The following commands are examples of how you can specify a region:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map("county", "west virginia")
map("county", region=c("maryland", "virginia", "west virginia"))
``` 

Try your home State.

Try some of the examples included at the end of the map {maps} documentation, from the previous search, or from [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/maps.pdf](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/maps.pdf)  

## 1.5  A Graphical user interface for R: Rcmdr (R COMMANDER)  

R Commander (Rcmdr) is an expanded RGui that allows users to run basic statistical functions in R using menu bars, icons, and information fields. It was created for students in introductory statistics courses so they could see how the software worked without learning a large number of command line scripts. Rcmdr is a great way to begin familiarizing yourself with R and statistics within a standardized framework.   

To install and load Rcmdr from the R console, run the following commands.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Rcmdr", dep = TRUE)  
library(Rcmdr)  
```

These commands should open the R Commander GUI. 

### 1.5.1 Importing Data with Rcmdr  

Navigate to the **Data** toolbar, scroll down to **Import data,** and then select **from text file, clipboard, or URL.**

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig19_rgui.jpg)

Replace Dataset with sand2 and make sure that **Field Separator** is set to **Commas.** 

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig21_rgui.jpg)  

Once you select OK, a Windows Explorer box appears. Select the file you wish to import. For this example, you want to select sand.txt. Next, use the R Commander GUI functions to View Dataset and confirm that the data imported with 5 columns.  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig22_rgui.jpg)  

A quicker way to import data that is already imported as an object in R is to simply click on the box next to **Data set** in the Rcmdr GUI. This opens a window that lists all of the dataset objects that have been created during your R session. In our case, we want to select the **sand2** dataset. 

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig5_rgui.jpg)

### 1.5.2 Creating Graphs 

In the **Graphs** drop-down menu in the Rcmdr GUI, select **Histogram.**  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig23_rgui.jpg)

Select **sand** as the variable, click on the **Option** tab, and make sure the Number of bins is set to **auto** for the first time. You can edit it later. Click **OK.** A plot appears in a separate window within the RGui. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hist(sand$sand, col="darkgrey", xlab="sand", ylab="frequency", main="")
```

Navigate back to R Commander window and select the **Graphs** menu again. This time select **Boxplot** and choose **sand** as the variable. Click **Plot by groups** and select **landuse** as the variable. Next, switch to the **Options** tab to ensure that outliers are identified **automatically.** Click **OK.** 

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig25_rgui.jpg)  

If you want to change something slightly, edit the command line in the script window, select the entire command, and clcik **Submit.** Note that commands in the R Commander script window are not preceded by > as they are in the R Console.  

Use R help or an online search engine to find information about the desired function. For instance, if you would like to change the color of the bars in the histogram to red, you would edit the `col` argument in the `Hist()` command as follows.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
with(sand2, Hist(sand, scale="frequency", breaks="Sturges", col="red")) #command used by Rcmdr; notice the function `Hist`

#or
```

```{r}
hist(sand$sand, col="red", xlab="sand", ylab="frequency", main="")  #the function `hist` in a R base package
``` 

Edit the Rcmdr script and select the line. Click **Submit** to plot the updated histogram.  

###1.5.3 Simple Statistics

You can use the options in the Statistics menu to calculate basic summary statistics. A couple of examples are provided below.  
**Example 1**

Navigate to the **Statistics** drop-down menu and select **Summary - Active dataset.**  

Results are returned in the Output Window and consist of a summary of the number of records for each categorical (name) variable and some basic measures of the continuous (numeric) variables.  

```{r}
summary(sand)
```
**Example 2**  
Navigate back to the **Statistics** menu and select **Means - One-way ANOVA.** If you wish to reuse your model, give it a unique name in the Enter name for model: field. Select **landuse** in the **Groups** field and set **sand** as the Response Variable. Click **OK.** 

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig29_rgui.jpg)  



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RcmdrMisc)
```

```{r}
AnovaModel.1 <- aov(sand ~ landuse, data = sand)
summary(AnovaModel.1)
with(sand, numSummary(sand, groups=landuse, statistics = c("mean", "sd")))
```

This result indicates that the sand contents of these landuses are not significantly different (Pr = 0.422).  Note that this simple analysis has not accounted for the two kinds of horizons analyzed (A and B) or for the non-independent nature of multiple samples collected at each location. (It also doesn't tell you if comparing sand content between land uses is a reasonable thing to do.)  

Just as in the R editor window, you can save the Rcmdr script that you generate by using the File drop-down menu in the Rcmdr GUI and selecting **Save script as.**

Save the Rcmdr script that you just created as **sand_rcmdr.R** in your working directory. You can also save your workspace, markdown file, and output using the File drop-down menu. 

### 1.5.4 Importing and Executing a Saved Rcmdr Script  

**Rcmdr**  

You can open a saved R commander script in R commander or in R editor. Sometimes, however, scripts saved with R Commander include code for R commander that isn't apparent and won't run directly from R editor. As an example, open the script we just saved. First, open the script with R commander, and then open it in R editor. Using the saved R commander script in R Commander, open and view R Commander and navigate to File, Open Script file, and select sand_rcmdr.R. You will be asked if you want to save the current log file (Click **No** to clear without saving). Your saved script will appear in the Script Window.  

Place your cursor on any command line and click **submit.** The output and graphs display as they did when you first executed them through the menu system of R Commander.  

**R Console**

Click on the RGui console, navigate to the **File** drop-down menu, and click **Open script.** A Windows Explorer box appears. Navigate to sand_rcmdr.R. A new R editor window opens up within R. Select the first two lines of the script using your mouse, right-click, and select **Run line or selection.**

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig31_rgui.jpg)  

This is a data input step. The next time you open R, you will need to import the dataset again. If you update the file sand_example.csv, the changes will be reflected when you rerun the analysis.  

Select the next line and click **Run.** 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(relimp, pos=14)
```

This loads a package that R Commander uses to run the script. Next, select the lines for any command that you wish to execute; for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
with(sand2, Hist(sand, scale="frequency", breaks="Sturges", col="darkgray"))
```

This recreates the histogram graph. To get more information about how to use this function, including its usage and arguments, and how to modify the default output, enter the following command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(Hist)
``` 

You can edit this command in R editor and save your changes for later. Enter the following script to change the label of the x-axis and the color of the graph.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Hist(sand2$sand, scale="frequency", breaks="Sturges", col="lightblue", xlab = "Total Sand")
``` 

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig3_rgui.jpg) 

At the top of the R editor window enter the following: #this is a demo of how to use R editor with an R Commander Script. Next, select all and run the entire script. Save your R script using the file icon or in the File menu. Close R. 

## 1.6 RStudio  

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to interact with R more readily. RStudio is similar to the RGui, but is more user friendly. It has more drop-down menus, windows, and customization options. When you open RStudio on your machine, you will see three windows: the console window (just like in the RGui) and two other windows composed of multiple tabs. The upper right window has two tabs: Environment and History. The Environment tab keeps track of datasets that you import and objects that you create. The History tab keeps a history of all of the commands you've executed during your Rstudio session. The lower right window is composed of five tabs: Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer.

The **Files** tab shows all the files and folders in your default workspace as if you were in Windows Explorer.

The **Plots** tab displays figures generated through the R Console (for example, the results of `plot()` would be displayed here).

The **Packages** tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R; if not, any command related to that package won't work and you will need to select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the Install Packages icon.

The **Help** tab searches for help regarding R functions, packages, or topics. 

The **Viewer** tab shows local web content, such as static HTML files written to the session temporary directory (i.e. files with paths generated by the tempfile function) or a locally run web application. (This tab is typically used only by advanced users.)

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig32_rgui.jpg)  

Note that the figure above shows a fourth window open named "Untitled1." This is an R script window and is very similar to the one we looked at in RGui. To open the R script window in RStudio, use the **File** drop-down menu, click **New File,* and then click **R Script.** 

For further information on how to use RStudio, visit: <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/sections/200107586-Using-RStudio">Using RStudio</a>

### 1.6.1 Working with Scripts  

In RStudio, set your working directory to C:\workspace either by using the drop-down menus (Session, Set Working Directory, or Choose Directory) or by typing the following into the RStudio Console window and pressing Enter. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/workspace")
```

Next, open the script you created in R commander and edited in R editor. You do this by navigating to the **File** menu, clicking **Open File,** and then selecting **sand_rcmdr.R.** Run commands from within the script by selecting the first command (first two lines of code) and clicking **Run** from the task bar above the script. 

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig33_rgui.jpg)  

Note that the command line is passed to the console (lower left) and the data file appears in the workspace (upper right) as sand2. Click on the file name **sand2** under the **Environment** tab in the top left quadrant; note that the console shows the corresponding command prompt > view(sand2).  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig34_rgui.jpg)

Switch back to the sand_rcmdr.R script window, select the command to create a histogram (begins with Hist), and click **Run.** You will get this error message: "Error: could not find function 'Hist.'" 

**What happened?**

The Hist function is only available through the Rcmdr package. Because Rcmdr is not loaded in RStudio, you cannot use the `Hist()` command unless you load Rcmdr (`library(Rcmdr)`). To use the `Hist` command without loading the Rcmdr package, go to the console and use the up arrow key on your keyboard to edit the command so that it has a lowercase h as in hist, press the Enter key. Next, edit the Hist command in the R script; do the same for Boxplot (i.e., change to boxplot).  

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig35_rgui.jpg)  

Select both commands (hist and boxplot) and click **Run** again. Ignore the warning message. You will see the most recent graph in the Plot window. Use the arrows to scroll through all graphs produced during this session. Save your script by clicking in the R script window and then navigating to **File > Save As.** Name the file: **sand_studio.R.**  


### 1.6.2 Help Features 

To learn more about the function you are using and the options and arguments available, take advantage of some of the help functions in RStudio:

1. Use the Help tab in the lower right to search commands (such as hist) or objects (such as histogram). 
2. AFter typing a command (such as hist) in the Console window, place your cursor at the end of the function and press F1 on your keyboard to bring up more information about the command. Information will appear under the Help tab on the lower right. 
3. Just like in R, you can type `?hist` in the Console window to bring up a help page. This is also displayed under the Help tab in the lower right. 
4. Finally, you can also search for help on any function (even if you don't have the package installed) by typing the following:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
help.search("histogram")
``` 

![R GUI image](figure/ch1_fig36_rgui.jpg)  

Look through the usage and arguments in the help documents. Re-enter the `hist` function; evaluate the effects of changing color, breaks, freq, and labels.  
```{r}
hist(sand$sand, freq=TRUE, breaks=12, xlim = c(15, 40), main = "Histogram of Sand", sub = "with 12 bins", col ="lightblue", ylab = "Counts", xlab = "Total Sand") 
```

Note how changing the breaks argument alters the appearance of the graph. The breaks argument tells R how the individual values should be counted in bins or groups. The xlim argument tells R where to set the upper and lower limit of the x-axis.  

Note that this arbitrarily sets the bin breaks using a list c(x1,x2,x3..). This can be a good way to separate groups, but it does so in a way that may alter the way you visualize the distribution. This will work for any function in the console command prompt. 
**Exercise::
Determine how you would change the chart title to "Histogram" and change the number of breaks (and therefore subtitles) to 6 bins. Plot and examine the results.


## 1.7  Introduction to the soilDB Package

The [soilDB](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/docs/soilDB/soilDB-Intro.html?root=aqp) package was created to more readily analyze data from USDA-NCSS soil databases in R. It includes a series of convenience functions that allow you to quickly access soil data from a wide range of sources, including NASIS, KSSL, OSDs, and several others. The convenience functions typically return data as a [`SoilProfileCollection` object](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/docs/aqp/aqp-intro.html?root=aqp): a special datatype designed specifically for soil information. In this module, we are only going to focus on the `fetchKSSL()` function. Use the following script to examine KSSL data for the Hartleton soil series. Feel free to replace Hartleton with a soil series in your MLRA. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# load required packages
library(soilDB)
library(aqp)
library(lattice)

# fetch all KSSL data 'correlated as' Hartleton from the December 2015 snapshot
# details on the data processing: https://github.com/dylanbeaudette/process-kssl-snapshot
pedons <- fetchKSSL(series='Hartleton') 

# reduce margins for a bigger figure
par(mar=c(0,0,3,0)) 

# default plot method for SoilProfileCollection objects
plot(pedons, name='hzn_desgn', cex.names=0.85, axis.line.offset=-4, color='clay') 

# compute soil depth class
sdc <- getSoilDepthClass(pedons, name='hzn_desgn', top='hzn_top', bottom='hzn_bot') 
site(pedons) <- sdc
```

```{r}
#summary statistics for soil depth
tapply(pedons$depth, pedons$taxonname, summary) 
``` 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#data structure and variable names
str(pedons) 
``` 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# slab() is used to aggregate selected variables within a collections of soil profiles along depth-slices; in this example we are aggregating clay, sand, and organic carbon
s <- slab(pedons, taxonname ~ clay + sand + oc)

#specify color and line width to be used in plot
tps <- list(superpose.line=list(col='RoyalBlue', lwd=2)) 

# slice-wise median and 25th/75th percentiles are reasonable estimations of central tendency and spread
xyplot(top ~ p.q50 | variable, data=s, ylab='Depth',
        xlab='median bounded by 5th and 95th percentiles',
        lower=s$p.q25, upper=s$p.q75, ylim=c(155,-5),
        panel=panel.depth_function, alpha=0.25, sync.colors=TRUE,
        prepanel=prepanel.depth_function,
        cf=s$contributing_fraction,
        par.strip.text=list(cex=0.8),
        strip=strip.custom(bg=grey(0.85)),
        layout=c(3,1), scales=list(x=list(alternating=1, relation='free'), y=list(alternating=3)),
        par.settings=tps, auto.key=list(columns=1, lines=TRUE, points=FALSE))
``` 

See the realted [tutorial on fetchKSSL()](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/docs/soilDB/KSSL-demo.html?root=aqp) for more details. 

## 1.8 Review
Given what you now know about R and RStudio, try to answer the following questions:

1. How can the `str()` function be used?

2. What are packages?

3. Which R function is used to load packages?

4. What types of files can you save in R? 

5. What would be the result of `plot(clay ~ organiccarbon, data=KSSL)`?
