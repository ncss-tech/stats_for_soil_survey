# Linear Regression

![Statistics for Soil Survey course banner image](static-figures/logo.jpg)

## Introduction

Linear regression models the linear relationship between a response variable (y) and an predictor variable (x). 

$y = \alpha + \beta x + e$

Where:

  * $y$ = the dependent variable

  * $\alpha$ = the intercept of the fitted line

  * $\beta$ = the Regression coefficient, i.e. slope of the fitted line. Strong relationships will have high values.

  * $x$ = the independent variable (aka explanatory or predictor variable(s) )

  * $e$ = the error term

Linear regression has been used for soil survey applications since the early 1900s when @briggs1907 developed a pedotransfer function to estimate the wilting coefficient as a function of soil particle size. 

Wilting coefficient = 0.01(sand) + 0.12(silt) + 0.57(clay)

When more than one independent variable is used in the regression, it is referred to as multiple linear regression. In regression models, the response (or dependent) variable must always be continuous. The predictor (or independent) variable(s) can be continuous or categorical. In order to use linear regression or any linear model, the errors (i.e. residuals) must be normally distributed. Most environmental data are skewed and require transformations to the response variable (such as square root or log) for use in linear models. Normality can be assessed using a QQ plot or histogram of the residuals.


## Linear Regression Example

Now that we've got some of the basic theory out of the way we'll move on to a real example, and address any additional theory where it relates to specific steps in the modeling process. The example selected for this chapter comes from the Mojave desert. The landscape is composed primarily of closed basins ringed by granitic hills and mountains (Peterson, 1981). The problem tackled here is modeling mean annual air temperature as a function of PRISM, digital elevation model (DEM) and Landsat derivatives.

This climate study began in 1998 as part of a national study run by the National Lab and led by Henry Mount [@mount2002]. The objective was to determine if the hyperthermic line was consistent across the southern US, which at the time was thought to be ~3000 in elevation. Up until 2015 their were 77 active MAST sites, and 12 SCAN sites throughout MLRA 30 and 31.

For more details see the "MLRA 30 - Soil Climate Study - Soil Temperature" project in NASIS, on [GitHub](https://github.com/smroecker/mast-mojave), or by [@roecker2012].

```{r include=FALSE}
# support for bigger downloads on slow connections
options(timeout = 600)
```

```{r nasis-project, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

library(soilDB)

prj <- get_project_from_NASISWebReport(mlrassoarea = "8-VIC", fiscalyear = 2015)

subset(prj, projectname == "MLRA 30 - Soil Climate Study - Soil Temperature")

```

In addition to the 11-IND MAST modeling efforts there has also been two published studies on the Mojave. The first was by @schmidlin1983 who examined both the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts in Nevada. The second was by @bai2010 who examined the Mojave Desert in California. Both studies developed regression models using elevation, but @schmidlin1983 also incorporated latitude. The results from @bai2010 displayed considerably larger areas of hyperthermic soils than @schmidlin1983. This made be due to the unconventional method used by @bai2010 to measure MAST.


## Data

### Henry Mount Database

The Henry Mount Database already has 79 of the sites from the Mojave. However only 8 have temperature records.

```{r henry, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}

f <- fetchHenry(sso = "8-VIC")

length(unique(f$sensors$user_site_id))

```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
f <- fetchHenry(sso = "8-VIC")
```


### Aggregate Time Series

For our purposes the daily soil temperature measurements need to be aggregated to the mean annual soil temperature (MAST). However, depending data you query using, `fetchHenry()` maybe able to return pre-aggregated results using the `gran` function argument. 

```{r aggregate, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r aggregate2, eval=TRUE, results='hide', echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sf))
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}

# extract the site and sensor data frames from the list
ms_df <- f$soiltemp
s     <- f$sensors
  

# rename 2 columns
ms_df <- mutate(
  ms_df,
  day  = date_time,
  Jday = doy
  )


# Plot sites visually inspect for flat lines and spikes
ms_df %>%
  filter(name == "JVOHV2-50") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = sensor_value)) +
  geom_line()


# Aggregate by Year, Month, and Julian day (i.e. 1-365, 366 for leap years)
# compute number of days per site
ms_n_df <- ms_df %>%
  group_by(sid, day) %>%
  summarise(mast = mean(sensor_value, na.exclude = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(sid) %>%
  summarise(numDays = sum(!is.na(mast)), ) %>%
  ungroup()


# compute mast per year
ms_site_df <- ms_df %>%
  group_by(sid, Jday) %>%
  summarise(mast = mean(sensor_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(sid) %>%
  summarise(mast = mean(mast, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()


# merge mast & numDays
mast_df <- as.data.frame(s) %>%
  select(name, sid, sensor_depth, geometry) %>%
  left_join(ms_site_df, by = "sid") %>%
  left_join(ms_n_df,    by = "sid") %>%
  filter(sensor_depth == 50 & !is.na(mast))

head(mast_df)
```

Note that we have a column in result data.frame called `"geometry"` since we created it from an sf object.

### Final Dataset

Since the Henry Mount database is partially incomplete we will proceed with the aggregation from the original txt files.


```{r dataset, eval = TRUE}
# Read mast data
githubURL <- url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/master/data/mast_mojave.Rdata")

load(githubURL)
```


## Spatial data

### Plot Coordinates

Where do our points plot? To start we need to convert them to a spatial object first. Then we can create an interactive we map using `mapview`. Also, if we wish we can also export the locations as a Shapefile.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(sf)
library(mapview)

# convert to sites to a spatial object 
mast_sf <- st_as_sf(mast_df, coords = c('lon', 'lat'), crs = 4326)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# plot
mapview(mlra, alpha.region = 0, lwd = 2) +
  mapview(mast_sf)
```


### Extracting Spatial Data

Prior to any spatial analysis or modeling, you will need to develop a suite of geodata files that can be intersected with your field data locations. This is, in and of itself a difficult task and should be facilitated by your Regional GIS Specialist. The geodata files typically used would consist of derivatives from a DEM or satellite imagery, and a 'good' geology map. Prior to any prediction it is also necessary to ensure the geodata files have the same projection, extent, and cell size. Once we have the necessary files we can construct a list in R of the file names and paths, read the geodata into R, and then extract the geodata values where they intersect with field data.

As you can see below their are numerous variables we could inspect.

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(raster)
library(sf)

# load raster stack from GitHub
githubURL <- url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/master/data/mast_mojave_rs.rds")
geodata_r <- readRDS(githubURL)


# Extract the geodata and add to a data frame
mast_sf <- st_transform(mast_sf, crs = 5070)
data <- raster::extract(geodata_r, st_coordinates(mast_sf))
data <- cbind(st_drop_geometry(mast_sf), data)

# convert aspect
data$northness <- abs(180 - data$aspect)


# random sample
vars <- c("elev", "temp", "precip", "solar", "tc_1", "twi")
idx <- which(names(geodata_r) %in% vars)
geodata_s <- sampleRegular(geodata_r[[idx]], size = 1000)

```


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generally before we begin modeling it is good to explore the data. By examining a simple summary we can quickly see the breakdown of our data. It is important to look out for missing or improbable values. Probably the easiest way to identify peculiarities in the data is to plot it.

```{r eval = TRUE}

summary(data)

```

You may recall from discussion of EDA that QQ plots are a visual way to inspect the normality of a variable. If the variable is normally distributed, the points (e.g. soil observations) should line up along the straight line.

```{r qq-plot, eval = TRUE}

# QQ plot

ggplot(data, aes(sample = mast)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()

```

By examining the correlations between some of the predictors we can also determine whether they are *collinear* (e.g. > 0.6). This is common for similar variables such as Landsat bands, terrain derivatives, and climatic variables. Variables that are colinear are redundant and contain no additional information. In addition, collinearity will make it difficult to estimate our regression coefficients. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE}

vars <- c("mast", "elev", "temp", "precip", "tc_2", "tc_1", "tc_3")
GGally::ggpairs(data[vars])

vars <- c("mast", "slope", "twi", "northness", "solar", "solarcv")
GGally::ggpairs(data[vars])

```

The correlation matrices and scatter plots above show that that MAST has moderate correlations with some of the variables, particularly the elevation and the climatic variables. 

Examining the density plots on the diagonal axis of the scatter plots we can also see that some variables are skewed.


### Compare Samples vs Population 

Since our data was not randomly sampled, we had better check the distribution of our samples vs the population. We can accomplish this by overlaying the sample distribution of predictor variables vs a large random sample.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

geodata_df <- as.data.frame(geodata_s)

geodata_df <- rbind(
  data.frame(source = "sample",     data[names(geodata_df)]),
  data.frame(source = "population", geodata_df)
)

geodata_l <- pivot_longer(geodata_df,
                          cols = -source)

ggplot(geodata_l, aes(x = value, fill = source)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") +
  ggtitle("Evaluation of Sample Representativeness")

```

The overlap between our sample and the population appear satisfactory.


## Linear modeling

R has several functions for fitting linear models. The most common is arguably the `lm()` function from the stats R package, which is loaded by default. The `lm()` function is also extended through the use of several additional packages such as the car and caret R packages. Another noteworthy R package for linear modeling is rms, which offers the `ols()` function for linear modeling. The rms R package [@harrell2015] offers an 'almost' comprehensive alternative to `lm()' and it's accessory function. Each function offers useful features, therefore for the we will demonstrate elements of both. Look for comments (i.e. #) below referring to rms or stats. 

```{r lm-ols, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# stats
fit_lm <- lm(mast ~ elev + aspect + twi + solar + solarcv + tc_1 + tc_2 + tc_3 + precip + temp, data = data, weights = data$numDays)


# rms R package

library(rms)

dd <- datadist(data)
options(datadist = "dd")

fit_ols <- ols(mast ~ elev + aspect + twi + solar + solarcv + tc_1 + tc_2 + tc_3 + precip + temp, data = data, x = TRUE, y = TRUE, weights = data$numDays)

```


### Diagnostics

#### Residual plots

Once we have a model we need to assess residuals for linearity, normality, and homoscedastivity (or constant variance). Oddly this is one area were the rms R package does not offer convient functions for plotting residuals, therefore we'll simply access the results of `lm()`.

```{r residuals, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
par(mfcol = c(2, 2))
```

```{r}
# residual
plot(fit_lm)

# partial residuals
termplot(fit_lm, partial.resid = TRUE, col.res = "black", pch = 16)

```

Remember the residuals are simply just the observed values minus the predicted values, which are easy enough to calculate. Alternatively we can simply extract them from the fitted model object.

```{r}
pred <- predict(fit_lm, data)
res  <- data$mast - pred
head(res)

# or 

head(residuals(fit_lm))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Manually plot the residuals
res <- data.frame(res, pred)

ggplot(res, aes(x = pred, y = res)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```


#### Multicolinearity

As we mentioned earlier multicolinearity should be avoided. To assess a model for multicolinearity we can compute the **variance inflation factor** (VIF). Its square root indicates the amount of increase in the predictor coefficients standard error. A value greater than 3 indicates a doubling the standard error. Rules of thumb vary, but a square root of vif greater than 2 or 3 indicates an unacceptable value [@faraway2004].

```{r vif, eval = TRUE}

# vif() function from the rms or car packages
sqrt(vif(fit_ols))

# or 

sqrt(vif(fit_ols)) > 3

```

The values above indicate we have several colinear variables in the model, which you might have noticed already from the scatter plot matrix.


### Variable selection & model validation

Modeling is an iterative process that cycles between fitting and evaluating alternative models. Compared to tree and forest models, linear and generalized models typically less automated. Automated model selection procedures are available, but should not be taken at face value because they may result in complex and unstable models. This is in part due to correlation amongist the predictive variables that can confuse the model. Also, the order in which the variables are included or excluded from the model effects the significance of the other variables, and thus several weak predictors might mask the effect of one strong predictor. Regardless of the approach used, variable selection is probably the most controversial aspect of linear modeling.

Both the rms and caret packages offer methods for variable selection and cross-validation. In this instance the rms approach is a bit more convenient, with the one line call to `validate()`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)


# rms
## stepwise selection
validate(fit_ols, bw = TRUE)

```

The results for `validate()` above show which variables were retained and deleted. Above we can see a dot matrix of which variables were retained during each of the 10 iterations of from cross validation. In addition, we can see the difference between the training and test accuracy and error metrics. Remember that it is the test accuracy we should pay attention too.


### Final model & accuracy assessment

Once we have a model we are 'happy' with we can fit the final model, and call `validate()` again which gives performace metrics such as `R$2` and the mean square error (MSE). If we want the root mean square error (RMSE), which is in the original units of our measurements we can take the square root of MSE using `sqrt()`. 

```{r final-model, eval = TRUE}

# rms
final_ols <- ols(mast ~ elev + solarcv + tc_1 + tc_2, data = data, weights = data$numDays, x = TRUE, y = TRUE)
final_ols

set.seed(42)
validate(final_ols, method = "crossvalidation", B = 10)

data$pred <- predict(final_ols)


# RMSE
sqrt((MSE = 1.7218))
caret::RMSE(pred = data$pred, obs = data$mast)

# R2
caret::R2(pred = data$pred, obs = data$mast, formula = "traditional")


# plot model fit

ggplot(data, aes(x = mast, y = pred)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Model Fit")

```



### Model Interpretation

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# Model accuracy, residuals, and slopes (e.g. coefficents)
final_ols


# Anova
anova(final_ols)


# Model Effects
plot(summary(final_ols))


# Plot Effects
ggplot(Predict(final_ols),
       addlayer = geom_hline(yintercept = c(8, 15, 22), linetype = "dotted") +
         scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(8, 15, 22))
       )


# Vary solarcv (North = 23; Flat = 33; South = 55)
ggplot(Predict(final_ols, elev = NA, solarcv = c(23, 33, 51))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(8, 15, 22), linetype = "dotted") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(8, 15, 22))

```



## Generate spatial predictions

```{r predict-raster, eval=FALSE}

# Predict mast model
predfun <- function(model, data) {
  v <- predict(model, data, se.fit=TRUE)
  }

mast_r <- predict(geodata_r, final_ols, fun = predfun, index = 1:2, progress = 'text')

names(mast_r) <- c("MAST", "SE")

```


## Create Map

```{r tmap, eval = FALSE}

# mast
plot(mast_r)

```


## Exercise

1. Load the CA790 MAST dataset.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/master/chapters/6_linear_models/yosemite-example/henry_CA790_data.csv"
mast2 <- read.csv(url)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
mast2_sf <- st_as_sf(mast2,
                     coords = c("wgs84_longitude", "wgs84_latitude"),
                     crs = 4326
                     )
```
2. Fit a linear model.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
fit_lm <- lm(MAST ~ elev + solar + tci + o.hz.thick, data = mast2, weights = mast2$days.of.data)

library(rms)

vars <- c("MAST", "Winter", "Summer", "STR", "elev", "solar", "tci", "o.hz.thick")
dd <- datadist(mast2[vars])
options(datadist = "dd")

fit_ols <- ols(Winter ~ elev + solar + tci + o.hz.thick, data = mast2, x = TRUE, y = TRUE, weights = mast2$days.of.data)
```
3. Examine the residuals and check for multi-collinearity.
    - Are their any outliers?
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plot(fit_lm)
termplot(fit_lm3, partial.resid = TRUE)
```
4. Perform a variable selection.
    - Does the automatic selection make sense?
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
validate(fit_ols, bw = TRUE)
```
5. Assess the model accuracy and plot the fit.
    - How do the train vs test accuracies compare?
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
validate(fit_ols, method = "crossvalidation", B = 10)
```
6. Summarize and plot the model effects.
    - Which variable has the steepest slope?
    - Which variable has the greatest effect?
    - Which variable explains the most variance?
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# - Which variable has the steepest slope?
coefficients(fit_ols)

# - Which variable has the greatest effect?
plot(summary(fit_ols))
plot(Predict(fit_ols, elev = NA, solar = c()))
plot(Predict(fit_ols, elev = NA, solar = c(33962, 68700, 85701)))

# - Which variable explains the most variance?
anova(fit_ols)
```
