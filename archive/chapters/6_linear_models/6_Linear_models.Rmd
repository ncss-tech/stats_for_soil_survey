# Introduction

Linear regression models the linear relationship between a response variable (y) and an predictor variable (x). 

y = a + Bx + e

Where:

y = the dependent variable

a = the intercet of the fitted line

B = the Regression coefficient, i.e. slope of the fitted line. Strong relationships will have high values.

x = the independent variable (aka explanatory or predictor variable(s) )

e = the error term

[//]: # (- \beta_{0} = intercept of the fitted line)
[//]: # (- \beta_{1}x = slope of the fitted line)
[//]: # (- \varepsilon = the error term)

Linear regression has been used for soil survey applications since the early 1900s when Briggs and McLane (1907) developed a pedotransfer function to estimate the wilting coefficient as a function of soil particle size. 

Wilting coefficient = 0.01(sand) + 0.12(silt) + 0.57(clay)

When more than one independent variable is used in the regression, it is referred to as multiple linear regression. In regression models, the response (or dependent) variable must always be continuous. The predictor (or independent) variable(s) can be continuous or categorical. In order to use linear regression or any linear model, the errors (i.e. residuals) must be normally distributed. Most environmental data are skewed and require transformations to the response variable (such as square root or log) for use in linear models. Normality can be assessed using a QQ plot or histogram of the residuals.


# Linear Regression Example

Now that we've got some of the basic theory out of the way we'll move on to a real example, and address any additional theory where it relates to specific steps in the modeling process. The example selected for this chapter comes from Joshua Tree National Park (JTNP)(i.e. CA794) in the Mojave desert. The landscape is composed primarily of closed basins ringed by granitic hills and mountains (Peterson, 1981). The problem tackled here is modeling the distribution of surface rock fragments as a function of digital elevation model (DEM) and Landsat derivatives.

With this dataset we'll encounter some challenges. To start with, fan piedmont landscapes typically have relatively little relief. Since most of our predictors will be derivatives of elevation, that won't leave us with much to work with. Also, our elevation data comes from the USGS National Elevation dataset (NED), which provides considerably less detail than say LiDAR or IFSAR data (Shi et al., 2012). Lastly our pedon dataset like most in NASIS, hasn't received near as much quality control as have the components. So we'll need to wrangle some of the pedon data before we can analyze it. These are all typical problems encountered in any data analysis and should be good practice.


## Load packages

To start, as always we need to load some extra R packages. This is will become a familar routine every time you start R. Most of the basic functions we need to develop a linear regression model are contained in base R, but the following packages contain some useful spatial and data manipulation functions. Believe it or not we will use all of them and more.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# knit options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, background="#F7F7F7", fig.retina=1, dev="png", tidy=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, cache = TRUE)

```

```{r packages}

library(aqp)     # specialized soil classes and functions
library(soilDB)  # NASIS and SDA import functions
library(dplyr)   # data manipulation
library(tidyr)   # data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # graphing

```

## Read in data

Hopefully like all good soil scientists and ecological site specialists you enter your field data into NASIS. Better yet hopefully someone else did it for you! Once data are captured in NASIS it is much easier to import them into R, extract the pieces you need, manipulate them, model them, etc. If it's not entered into NASIS, it may as well not exist.

```{r import data}
# pedons <- fetchNASIS(rmHzErrors = FALSE) # beware the error messages, by default they don't get imported unless you override the default, which in our case shouldn't cause any problems

githubURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/master/data/ch7_data.Rdata"
load(url(githubURL))

str(pedons, 2) # Examine the makeup of the data we imported from NASIS.

```

# Exploratory analysis

## Data Wrangling

Generally before we begin modeling it is good to explore the data. By examining a simple summary we can quickly see the breakdown of our data. Unfortunately, odds are all the data haven't been consistently populated like they should be.

```{r consistency}

s <- site(pedons) # extract the site data frame from the pedons soil profile collection object

s$frags <- s$surface_total_frags_pct_nopf

# density plot
select(s, surface_cobbles, surface_gravel, surface_fine_gravel, frags) %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, color = key)) +
  geom_density(size = 1.5)

# histogram
ggplot(s, aes(x = frags)) +
  geom_histogram()

# summarize all columns that pattern match either "surface" or "frags"
t(sapply(s[grepl("surface|frags", names(s))], function(x) round(summary(x))))

# number of samples greater than 100
sum(s$frags > 100) 

# number of samples less than  1
sum(s$frags < 1)

```

Examining the results we can see that the distribution of our surface rock fragments are skewed. In addition, we apparently have values in excess of 100 and some that equal 0. Those values in excess of 100 are likely recording errors, while the values that equal 0 could either be truly 0 or NA.


## Geomorphic data

Another obvious place to look is at the geomorphic data in the site table. This information is intended to help differentiate where our soil observations exist on the landscape. If populated consistently it could potentially be used in future disaggregation efforts, as demonstrated by Nauman and Thompson (2014).

### Landform vs frags

```{r landform}

test <- s %>%
  group_by(landform) %>%
  summarize(p10 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)),
            p50 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.5,  na.rm = TRUE)),
            p90 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)),
            n   = length(frags)
  ) %>%
  as.data.frame()

# subset the data frame to only include landforms with greater than 3 observations
test <- subset(test, n > 10) 

# sort the data frame by the frags matrix column
arrange(test, - p50)

```

There are obviously a wide variety of landforms. However generally it appears that erosional landforms have the most surface rock fragments. Let's generalize the `landform` and have a closer look.

```{r}

# generalize the landform.string
s$landform_generic <- ifelse(grepl("fan|terrace|sheet|drainageway|wash", s$landform), "fan", "hill") 

test <- s %>%
  group_by(landform_generic) %>%
  summarize(p10 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)),
            p50 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.5,  na.rm = TRUE)),
            p90 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)),
            n   = length(frags)
  ) %>%
  as.data.frame()

# sort the data frame by the frags matrix column
arrange(test, - p50)

# density plot
select(s, frags, surface_cobbles, surface_gravel, landform_generic) %>%
  gather(key = "rocks", value = "percent", - landform_generic) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = percent, color = rocks)) +
  geom_density(size = 1.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ landform_generic)

```

So it does appear that erosional landforms generally do have more surface rock fragments than depositional landforms, but not by much. It also appears that most of the difference is coming from the amount of cobbles, as seen in the density plot.


### Hillslope position

```{r}

test <- s %>%
  group_by(landform_generic, hillslopeprof) %>%
  summarize(p10 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)),
            p50 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.5,  na.rm = TRUE)),
            p90 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)),
            n   = length(frags)
  ) %>%
  as.data.frame()

arrange(test, - p50)

```

If we examine the different hillslope positions for each generic landform we can see other trends. For hills, it appears that surface rock fragments decrease as we traverse up the slope, with the exception of the toeslopes which are typically associated with drainageways. On fans we see the opposite relationship, with toeslopes again being the exception. 


### Slope shape

```{r}

test <- s %>%
  group_by(landform_generic, paste(shapedown, shapeacross)) %>%
  summarize(p10 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)),
            p50 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.5,  na.rm = TRUE)),
            p90 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)),
            n   = length(frags)
  ) %>%
  as.data.frame()

arrange(test, - p50)

```

When examining slope shape on hills it appears that concave positions have greater amounts of surface rock fragments. I can't see any sensible pattern with slope shape on fans.


### Surface Morphometry, Depth and Surface Rock Fragments

```{r}

# Subset Generic landforms and Select Numeric Columns
s_sub <- select(s, landform_generic, frags, surface_gravel, bedrckdepth, slope, elev)

# Scatterplot Matrices
library(GGally)
ggpairs(s_sub, aes(color = landform_generic, alpha = 0.5))

```

In examing the correlation matrices we don't see a strong relationships with either elevation for slope gradient.


### Soil Scientist Bias

Next we'll look at soil scientist bias. The question being: Do some soil scientists have a tendency to describe more surface rock fragments than others? Due to the excess number of soil scientist that have worked on CA794, including detailees, we've filtered the names of soil scientist to include just the top 3 soil scientists with the most documentation and have given priority to those soil scientists when they occur together.

```{r}

# Custom function to filter out the data for the 3 soil scientists with the most data
s <- within(s, {
  old = descname
  descname2 = NA
  descname2[grepl("Stephen", old)] = "Stephen" # least senior
  descname2[grepl("Paul", old)]    = "Paul"
  descname2[grepl("Peter", old)]   = "Peter"   # most senior
  })

test <- s %>%
  group_by(landform_generic, descname2) %>%
  summarize(p10 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)),
            p50 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.5,  na.rm = TRUE)),
            p90 = round(quantile(frags, probs = 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)),
            n   = length(frags)
  ) %>%
  as.data.frame()

arrange(test, landform_generic, - p50)

```

In looking at the numbers it appears we have a bit of a trend on both fans and hills. We can see that Stephen always describes the least overall amount of surface rock fragments, while Paul and Peter trade places describing the most on hills and fans. By looking the maximum values we can also see who is recording surface rock fragments in excess of 100%. However, while these trends are suggestive and informative, they are not definitive because they don't take into account other factors. We'll examine this potential bias more closely later.


## Plot coordinates

Where do our points plot? We can plot the general location in R, but for a closer look, we'll export them to a Shapefile so that they can viewed in a proper GIS. Notice in the figure below the number of points that fall outside the survey boundary. What it doesn't show is the points in the Ocean or Mexico!

```{r plot}

library(sf)

idx <- complete.cases(s$x_sdt, s$y_std) # create an index to filter out pedons with missing coordinates# Convert soil profile collection to a spatial object
s_sub <- s[idx, ]
s_sf <- st_as_sf(s_sub,
                 coords = c("x_std", "y_std"),
                 crs = 4326
                 )
# reproject
s_sf <- st_transform(s_sf, crs = 5070) # reproject

# Read in soil survey area boundaries
ssa   <- read_sf(dsn = "D:/geodata/soils/soilsa_a_nrcs.shp", layer = "soilsa_a_nrcs")
ca794 <- subset(ssa, areasymbol == "CA794") # subset out Joshua Tree National Park
ca794 <- st_transform(ca794, crs = 5070)

# Plot
library(mapview)
mapview(ca794, fill = NA) +
  mapview(s_sf)

# Write shapefile of pedons
write_sf(s_sf, dsn = "C:/workspace2", "ca794_pedons", driver = "ESRI Shapefile", delete_dsn =  TRUE)


```


### Exercise 1: View the geodata in ArcGIS

- Examine the shapefile in ArcGIS along with our potential predictive variables (hint classify the Shapefile symbology using the frags column)
- Discuss with your group, and report your observations or hypotheses


## Extracting spatial data

Prior to any spatial analysis or modeling, you will need to develop a suite of geodata files that can be intersected with your field data locations. This is, in and of itself a difficult task and should be facilitated by your Regional GIS Specialist. Geodata files typically used would consist of derivatives from a DEM or satellite imagery. Prior to any prediction it is also necessary to ensure the geodata files have the same projection, extent, and cell size. Once we have the necessary files we can construct a list in R of the file names and paths, read the geodata into R, and then extract the geodata values where they intersect with field data.

As you can see below their is an almost limitless number of variables we could inspect.

```{r extract, eval=FALSE}

library(raster)

# set file path
folder <- "D:/geodata/project_data/R8-VIC/ca794/"

# list of file names
files <- c(
  z      = "ned30m_8VIC.tif",              # elevation
  slp    = "ned30m_8VIC_slope5.tif",       # slope gradient
  asp    = "ned30m_8VIC_aspect5.tif",      # slope aspect
  twi    = "ned30m_8VIC_wetness.tif",      # topographic wetness index
  twi_sc = "ned30m_8VIC_wetness_sc.tif",   # transformed twi
  ch     = "ned30m_8VIC_cheight.tif",      # catchment height
  z2str  = "ned30m_8VIC_z2stream.tif",     # height above streams
  mrrtf  = "ned30m_8VIC_mrrtf.tif",        # multiresolution ridgetop flatness index
  mrvbf  = "ned30m_8VIC_mrvbf.tif",        # multiresolution valley bottom flatness index
  solar  = "ned30m_8VIC_solar.tif",        # solar radiation
  precip = "prism30m_8VIC_ppt_1981_2010_annual_mm.tif",    # annual precipitation
  precipsum = "prism30m_8VIC_ppt_1981_2010_summer_mm.tif", # summer precipitation
  temp   = "prism30m_8VIC_tmean_1981_2010_annual_C.tif",   # annual temperature
  mast   = "mast30m_ca794_2013.tif",       # mean annual soil temperature
  ls     = "landsat30m_8VIC_b123457.tif",  # landsat bands
  pc     = "landsat30m_8VIC_pc123456.tif", # principal components of landsat
  tc     = "landsat30m_8VIC_tc123.tif",    # tasseled cap components of landsat
  k      = "gamma30m_8VIC_namrad_k.tif",   # gamma radiometrics signatures
  th     = "gamma30m_8VIC_namrad_th.tif",
  u      = "gamma30m_8VIC_namrad_u.tif",
  cluster = "cluster152.tif"               # unsupervised classification
  )

# combine the folder directory and file names
geodata_f <- paste0(folder, files) 
names(geodata_f) <- names(files)

# Create a raster stack
geodata_r <- stack(geodata_f)

# Extract the geodata and add to a data frame
data <- raster::extract(geodata_r, as(s_sf, "Spatial"), sp = TRUE)@data

# Modify some of the geodata variables
idx <- aggregate(mast ~ cluster, data = data, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
names(idx)[2] <- "cluster_mast"
data <- merge(data, idx, by = "cluster", all.x =  TRUE)

data <- within(data, {
  mast = temp - 4
  cluster  = factor(cluster, levels = 1:15)
  cluster2 = reorder(cluster, cluster_mast)
  gsi      = (ls_3 - ls_1) / (ls_3 + ls_2 + ls_1)
  ndvi     = (ls_4 - ls_3) / (ls_4 + ls_3)
  sw       = cos(aspect - 255)
  twi_sc   = abs(twi - 13.8) # 13.8 = twi median
  })

# save(data, ca794, pedons, file = "C:/workspace2/github/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/data/ch7_data.Rdata")

```


## Examine Spatial Data 

With our spatial data in hand, we can now see whether any of the variables have a linear relationship with surface rock fragments. 

At the beginning of our analysis we noticed some issues with our data. Particularly that the distribution of our data was skewed, and included values greater than 100 and equal to 0. So before we start lets filter those out and transform the surface rock fragments using a logit transform.

```{r spatial}

train <- data
train$frags <- train$surface_total_frags_pct_nopf
train$frags <- ifelse(train$frags > 100, 99, train$frags)
train <- subset(train, frags > 0 & frags < 100, select = - c(peiid, taxonname, landform, x, y, argillic.horizon, descname)) # exclude frags greater than 100 and less than 1, and exclude some of the extra columns

# Create custom transform functions
logit <- function(x) log(x / (1 - x)) # logit transform
ilogit <- function(x) exp(x) / (1 + exp(x)) # inverse logit transform

# Transform
train <- transform(train,
  fragst     = logit(train$frags / 100),
  slp_log    = log(slp),
  ch_sqrt    = sqrt(ch + 1),
  z2str0     = ifelse(z2str < 1, TRUE, FALSE),
  z2str_log  = log(z2str + 1),
  mrrtf_sqrt = sqrt(mrrtf + 0.1),
  mrvbf_sqrt = sqrt(mrvbf + 0.1),
  hills      = mrvbf < 0.15
)


# Create list of predictor names
terrain1 <- c("slp_log", "solar", "mrrtf_sqrt", "mrvbf_sqrt")
terrain2 <- c("twi", "z2str0", "z2str_log", "ch_sqrt")
climate <- c("z", "precip", "precipsum", "temp")
ls <- paste0("ls_", 1:6)
pc <- paste0("pc_", 1:6)
tc <- paste0("tc_", 1:3)
rad <- c("k", "th", "u")

# Compute correlation matrices
# round(cor(train[c("fragst", terrain1)], use = "pairwise"), 2)
# round(cor(train[c("fragst", terrain2)], use = "pairwise"), 2)
# round(cor(train[c("fragst", climate)], use = "pairwise"), 2)
# round(cor(train[c("fragst", ls)], use = "pairwise"), 2)
# round(cor(train[c("fragst", pc)], use = "pairwise"), 2)
# round(cor(train[c("fragst", tc)], use = "pairwise"), 2)
# round(cor(train[c("fragst", rad)], use = "pairwise"), 2)

# Create scatterplots
# ggpairs(train[c("fragst", terrain1)])
ggpairs(train[c("fragst", terrain2)])
ggpairs(train[c("fragst", climate)])

# ggpairs(train[c("fragst", ls)])
ggpairs(train[c("fragst", tc)])
# ggpairs(train[c("fragst", tc)])
# ggpairs(train[c("fragst", rad)])


# Create boxplots
ggplot(train, aes(x = cluster, y = frags)) + geom_boxplot()

```

The correlation matrices and scatter plots above show that that surface rock fragments have moderate correlations with some of the variables, particularly the landsat bands and derivatives. This makes sense given that surface rock fragments are at the surface, unlike most soil properties. 

By examining the correlations between some of the predictors we can also see that some are *collinear* (e.g. > 0.6), such as the landsat bands. Therefore these variables are redundant as they describe almost the same thing. This collinearity will also make it difficult to estimate our regression coefficients. Considering that we already have other derivatives of landsat in our dataset, which are intentionally designed to reduce their collinearity, we may as well exclude the landsat bands from our dataset all together.

Examining the density plots on the diagonal axis of the scatterplots we can see that some variables are skewed while others are bimodal. Lastly the boxplot show that the range of surface fragments varies by cluster.


# Modeling

# Model Training

Modeling is an iterative process that cycles between fitting and evaluating alternative models. Compared to tree and forest models, linear and generalized models require more scrunity from the user. Automated model selection procedures are available, but should not be taken at face value because they may result in complex and unstable models. This is in part due to correlation amongst the predictive variables that can confuse the model. Also, the order in which the variables are included or excluded from the model effects the significance of the other variables, and thus several weak predictors might mask the effect of one strong predictor. Regardless of the approach used, variable selection is probably the most controversial aspect of linear modeling.


## Variable Selection

The example below is known as a 'exhaustive selection' procedure using the `regsubsets()` function from the leaps R package (Lumley, 2020). The `regsubsets()` function constructs a model for every possible combination of variables and determines which combination results in the most accurate model. For an example of alternative variable selection approaches, see James et al. (2014).

```{r}

library(leaps)

# Subset training dataset
train2 <- train[c("fragst", "hills", terrain1, terrain2, climate, pc, tc, rad)]
train2 <- train2[complete.cases(train2), ] 

# Find best model
test <- regsubsets(fragst ~ ., data = train2, nvmax = 10)

# Summarize the best model and plot
test_sum <- summary(test)

adjR2 <- data.frame(
  adjR2 = test_sum$adjr2, 
  n = 1:length(test_sum$adjr2)
  )

ggplot(adjR2, aes(x = n, y = adjR2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

coef(test, 5)

# Fit best model
fragst_lm <- lm(fragst ~ twi + z + precipsum + tc_2 + tc_3, data = train)

```

The results from above show how the 'best' model's accuracy increases with the addition of each variable. This increase however diminishing with each additional variable. After 5 variables the point of diminishing returns has been reached. The coefficients for the best model with 5 variables can be extracted with by using the `coef()` function as show above and fit using the `lm()` function. 

Even though the 'best' model is the most accurate model that can be achieved given our current list of predictors. It is important to scrutinize the combinations of variables selected using your knowledge of soil-landcape relationships. Suspicous variables should be questioned. The addition or removal of more variables can be tested using the `add1()` or `drop1()` functions. Both functions give a ranges of metrics. Typically, however the AIC or Akaike information criteria is typically preferred because it pensionlized the model for each additional variable, similarly as the adjusted R2. Ultimately we want a model or variable that gives us the 'smallest' AIC.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Fit full model
full <- lm(fragst ~ ., data = train2) # "~ ." includes all columns in the data set, "-" removes variables

# Fit null model
null <- lm(fragst ~ 1, data = train) # "~ 1" just includes an intercept

# test adding variables
add1(fragst_lm, scope = formula(full), test = "F")

# test dropping variables
drop1(fragst_lm, test = "F")

```


## Examine the Model

```{r summary}

summary(fragst_lm)

library(effects)
plot(allEffects(fragst_lm))

```


## Residual Plots

After we're satisfied no additional variables will improve the fit, we need to evaluate its residuals, collinearity, accuracy, and model coefficients.

```{r diagnostics}

# Standard diagnostic plots for lm() objects
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fragst_lm)

termplot(fragst_lm, partial.resid = TRUE)

```


## Multicolinearity

The **variance inflation factor** (VIF) is used to assess collinearity amongst the predictors. Its square root indicates the amount of increase in the predictor coefficients standard error. A value greater than 3 indicates a doubling the standard error. Rules of thumb vary, but a square root of vif greater than 2 or 3 indicates an unacceptable value.

```{r}

library(car)

# vif() function from the car or rms packages
sqrt(vif(fragst_lm))

# or 

sqrt(vif(fragst_lm)) > 3

```

## Accuracy Assessment

**Accuracy** can be assessed using several different metrics.

- Adjusted R^2^ = proportion of variance explained
- Root mean square error (RMSE)
- Mean absolute error(MAE)


```{r}

# Adjusted R2
summary(fragst_lm)$adj.r.squared

# Generate predictions
train$predict <- ilogit(predict(fragst_lm, train)) * 100 # apply reverse transform

# Root mean square error (RMSE)
with(train, sqrt(mean((frags - predict)^2, na.rm = T)))

# Mean absolute error
with(train, mean(abs(frags - predict), na.rm = T))

# Plot the observed vs predicted values
plot(train$frags, train$predict, xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 100))
abline(0, 1)

sum(train$frags < 15)

sum(train$frags > 80)

# Examine the RMSE for each cluster
temp <- group_by(train, cluster) %>%
  summarize(
    rmse = round(sqrt(mean((frags - predict)^2, na.rm = T))), 
    n = length(frags)
  )

ggplot(temp, aes(x = cluster, y = rmse)) + 
  geom_point()

# fragst_lm <- update(null, . ~ . + pc_2 + pc_1 + temp + twi + precipsum + cluster) # add one or several variables to the model

# Examine the coefficients
summary(fragst_lm)

ilogit(fragst_lm$coefficients) * 100

anova(fragst_lm) # importance of each predictor assess by the amount of variance they explain

```


```{r}
# Custom function to return the predictions and their standard errors
predfun <- function(model, data) {
  v <- predict(model, data, se.fit = TRUE)
  cbind(
    p = as.vector(ilogit(v$fit) * 100),
    se = as.vector(ilogit(v$se.fit)) * 100)

### Exercise 2: View the predictions in ArcGIS

- Examine the raster predictions in ArcGIS  and compare them to your Shapefile that contain the original point observations (hint classify the Shapefile symbology using the frags column)
- Discuss with your group, and report your observations or hypotheses
