There are [many packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) available for working with spatial data, however we only have time to cover introducing a few common libraries.

A couple resources are linked here for 5 packages that provide different ways displaying spatial data graphically:

 - [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html)
 - [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [`ggmap`](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap)  
 - [`mapview`](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/)
 - [`mapdeck`](https://symbolixau.github.io/mapdeck/articles/mapdeck.html) 
 - [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
  
## Making Maps with R

![](static-figures/WSS-AOI-density.png)

R has become a powerful tool for visualization and interaction with spatial data. There are many tools available for making maps with R! It is not all geostatistics and coordinate reference system transformations. There are powerful ways to automate your GIS workflow from beginning to end--from creating terrain derivatives from a source DEM, to high-quality, publication-ready maps and interactive HTML/JavaScript widgets.

All of the details of this could fill several books! And it does!

## Spatial Data Sources

Spatial data sources: "raster" and "vector"
  
  * Raster data sources (grids/images): GeoTIFF, ERDAS, BIL, ASCII grid, WMS, ...
  * Vector data sources (points/lines/polygons): Shape File, ESRI File Geodatabase, KML, GeoJSON, GML, WFS, ...

Conventional data sources that can be *upgraded* to spatial data:
  
  * NASIS/LIMS reports: typically point coordinates
  * Web pages: [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/), [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text), or point coordinates
  * Excel file: typically point coordinates
  * CSV files: typically point coordinates
  * Photo EXIF information: typically point coordinates
  
Here are some R-based interfaces to NCSS data sources via [`soilDB`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/soilDB/index.html) package.
  
* Functions that return _tabular data_ which can be *upgraded* to spatial data:

  + [`fetchKSSL()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/KSSL-demo.html): KSSL "site" data contain x,y coordinates

  + [`fetchNASIS()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/fetchNASIS-mini-tutorial.html): NASIS "site" data contain x,y, coordinates

  <!-- + [`fetchRaCA()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/RaCA-demo.html): RaCA central pedon x,y coordinates (pending major overhaul based on recently measured SOC data) -->

* Functions that _return_ spatial data:

  + [`fetchSDA_spatial()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/fetchSDA_spatial.html): polygon, bounding box and centroid data from SSURGO, STATSGO and the `sapolygon` (Soil Survey Area Polygon) from Soil Data Access (SDA)

  + [`seriesExtent()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/series-extent.html): simplified series extent as polygons
  
  + [`fetchHenry()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/Henry-demo.html): sensor / weather station locations as points
  
  + [`SDA_query()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/SDA-tutorial-2.html): SSURGO data as points, lines, polygons (via SDA)
  
  + [`SDA_spatialQuery()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/SDA_spatialQuery.html): use points or polygons as a "query" to SDA
  
  + [`seriesExtent()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/seriesExtent.html) and [`taxaExtent()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/taxaExtent.html): extent of series and taxonomic classes derived from SSURGO (SoilWeb) in vector and raster format (800m resolution). The vector output is identical to series extents reported by [Series Extent Explorer](https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/see/)
  
  + [`mukey.wcs()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/mukey.wcs.html) and [`ISSR800.wcs()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/ISSR800.wcs.html) provide an interface to [gSSURGO (mukey), gNATSGO (mukey), and the ISSR-800 (gridded soil property) data](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/WCS-demonstration-01.html).
  


## Viewing Pedon Locations

( _Introducing the_ `sf` _package_ with `mapview`)


### Plotting Geographic Data 

Plotting the data as an R graphic can give you some idea of how data look spatially and whether their distribution is what you expect.

Typos are relatively common when coordinates are manually entered. Viewing the data spatially is a quick way to see if any points plot far outside of the geographic area of interest and therefore clearly have an error.

```{r eval = TRUE}
# plot the locations of the gopheridge pedons with R
# 
# Steps:
# 1) create and inspect an sf data.frame object
# 2) plot the data with mapview

# load libraries
library(aqp)
library(soilDB)
library(sf)
library(mapview)

# this creates sample gopheridge object in your environment
data("gopheridge", package = "soilDB")

# replace gopheridge object with fetchNASIS() (your data)
# gopheridge <- fetchNASIS()

# create simple features POINT geometry data.frame
# st_as_sf(): convert data.frame to spatial simple features, with points in $geometry 
# st_crs(): set EPSG:4326 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) as Well-Known Text (WKT)
gopher.locations <- st_as_sf(
  site(gopheridge), 
  coords = c('x_std','y_std'),
  crs = st_crs(4326)
)

# create interactive map with sfc_POINT object
#  use site_id in sf data.frame as labels
mapview(gopher.locations, label = gopher.locations$site_id)
```

### EXERCISE 1 (Spatial Intro)

In this exercise, you will create an interactive map with the pedons in your selected set. Then you will export them to a shapefile. Modify the code snippets below to make an R plot and a shapefile of pedon data loaded from your NASIS selected set. You will plot pedon locations using  the standard WGS84 longitude/latitude decimal degrees fields from Site table of NASIS. In some cases, these data might be incomplete; you need to handle this possibility.

Missing values in coordinates for sf/Spatial objects are not allowed. In this exercise you will create a subset SoilProfileCollection for the pedons that are not missing spatial data (`x_std` and `y_std`).

 1. Make a new R script, load the `aqp`, `soilDB`, `sf` and `mapview` packages and some pedons via `fetchNASIS()` (or similar source). 
 
```{r r_plot_pedons, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='show', warning=FALSE}
library(aqp)
library(soilDB)
library(sf)
library(mapview)

# get pedons from the selected set
pedons <- fetchNASIS(from = 'pedons')
```

 2. Use the base R `subset()` function to create a subset of your SoilProfileCollection using `is.na()`
  - `x_std` and `y_std` variables contain WGS84 longitude and latitude in decimal degrees. This is the standard format for location information used in NASIS.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# modify this code (replace ...) to create a subset
pedons.sp  <- aqp::subset(pedons, ...)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# answer 
pedons.sp  <- aqp::subset(pedons, !is.na(x_std) & !is.na(y_std))
```

 3. Create a `sf` data.frame from the site data in the SoilProfileCollection object `pedons.sp` using `aqp::site()`. Replace the `...` in the following code. Promoting a data.frame to sf POINT geometry requires that the X and Y columns be specified.
 
```{r}
pedon.locations <- sf::st_as_sf(
  ..., 
  coords = c('x_std', 'y_std'),
  crs = sf::st_crs(4326) #WGS84 GCS
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# answer 
pedon.locations <- sf::st_as_sf(
  aqp::site(pedons.sp), 
  coords = c('x_std','y_std'),
  crs = sf::st_crs(4326) #WGS84 GCS
)
```

 4. View your `sf` object `pedon.locations` interactively with `mapview`, and change the `map.types` argument to `'Esri.WorldImagery'`. Use the pedon.locations column `site_id` as the `mapview(label=...)` argument.
 
```{r}
# plot an interactive map
mapview(pedon.locations, 
        legend = FALSE, 
        map.types = 'OpenStreetMap')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# answer 
mapview(pedon.locations, 
        legend = FALSE, 
        map.types = 'Esri.WorldImagery',
        label = pedon.locations$site_id)
```

 5. Create a subset `sf` data.frame with only the following "site data" columns: `pedlabsampnum`, `pedon_id`, `taxonname`, `hillslopeprof`, `elev_field`, `slope_field`, `aspect_field`, `plantassocnm`, `bedrckdepth`, `bedrckkind`, `pmkind`, `pmorigin`. Select the target columns with `dplyr::select()` (or another method) by replacing the `...` in the following code.
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pedon.locations_sub <- dplyr::select(pedon.locations, ...) 

# see also base::subset(x, select=...)
```

 6. Export the spatial information in `pedon.locations_sub` to a shape file (.shp) with `sf::st_write()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# write to SHP; output CRS is geographic coordinate system WGS84
sf::st_write(pedon.locations_sub, "./NASIS-pedons.shp")
```

For an example of exporting data to shapefile with the `sp` package, see this tutorial: [**Export Pedons to Shapefile with `sp`**](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/export-points-from-NASIS.html).

#### Export for Google Earth (_.kml_)

Google Earth is a powerful viewer for point data. Geographic data is displayed in Google Earth using the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format.  

Using the [plotKML](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotKML/plotKML.pdf) package, you can easily create a KML file to inspect and view in Google Earth.  

See the related material in this tutorial: [**Export Pedons to Google Earth**](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/export-points-from-NASIS-to-Google-Earth.html). 


## Many Packages, Many Spatial Representations

### The `sf` package

[Simple Features Access](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sfa) is a set of standards that specify a common storage and access model of geographic features. It is used mostly for two-dimensional geometries such as point, line, polygon, multi-point, multi-line, etc. 

This is one of many ways of modeling the geometry of shapes in the real world. This model happens to be widely adopted in the **R** ecosystem via the `sf` package, and very convenient for typical data encountered by soil survey operations.

The [sf package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) represents the latest and greatest in spatial data processing within the comfort of an R session. It provides a "main" object class `sf` to contain geometric data and associated tabular data in a familiar `data.frame` format. `sf` methods work on a variety of different levels of abstraction and manipulation of those geometries.

Most of the sf package functions start with the prefix `st_`, such as: `st_crs()` (get/set coordinate reference system), `st_transform()` (project feature class to different coordinate reference system), `st_bbox()` (bounding box), `st_buffer()` (buffer). Many of these are "verbs" that are common GIS operations.

### The `sp` and `rgdal` Packages 

 > Please note that rgdal will be retired by the end of 2023, plan transition to sf/stars/terra functions using GDAL and PROJ at your earliest convenience.

The data structures ("classes") and functions provided by the [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) package have served a foundational role in the handling of spatial data in R for years. 

Many of the following examples will reference names such as `SpatialPoints`, `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, and `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`. These are specialized (S4) classes implemented by the `sp` package. 

Objects of these classes maintain linkages between all of the components of spatial data. For example, a point, line, or polygon feature will typically be associated with:
  
* coordinate geometry
* bounding box
* coordinate reference system
* attribute table

### Converting `sp` and `sf`

`sp` provides access to the same compiled code libraries (PROJ, GDAL, GEOS) as `sf`, but mostly via the interfaces in the separate `rgdal` package. 

For certain applications, such as some packages we demonstrate below, there are no `sp` "interfaces" to the methods -- only `sf`, or vice-versa. In the future, all R spatial code using `sp` will have to migrate to `sf`/`stars` or `terra` functions.

For now the different package object types are interchangeable, and you may find yourself having to do this for a variety of reasons. You can convert between object types as neede using `sf::as_Spatial()` or `sf::st_as_sf`. 

Check the documentation (`?functionname`) to figure out what object types different methods need as input; and check an input object's class with `class()` or `inherits()`.

### Importing / Exporting Vector Data

Import a feature class from a ESRI File Geodatabase or shape file. 

If you have a _.shp_ file, you can specify the whole path, including the file extension in the `dsn` argument, or just the folder. 

For a Geodatabase, you should specify the feature class using the `layer` argument. Note that a trailing "/" is omitted from the `dsn` (data source name) and the ".shp" suffix is omitted from the `layer`.

#### `sf` 

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- sf::st_read(dsn = 'E:/gis_data/ca630/FG_CA630_OFFICIAL.gdb', layer = 'ca630_a')
x <- sf::read_sf(dsn = 'E:/gis_data/ca630/pedon_locations.shp')
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
sf::st_write(x, dsn = 'E:/gis_data/ca630/pedon_locations.shp')
sf::write_sf(x, dsn = 'E:/gis_data/ca630/pedon_locations.shp')
```

#### `sp` / `rgdal` 

Export object `x` to shapefile. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- rgdal::readOGR(dsn = 'E:/gis_data/ca630/FG_CA630_OFFICIAL.gdb', layer = 'ca630_a')
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
rgdal::writeOGR(x, dsn = 'E:/gis_data/ca630/pedon_locations.shp', driver = 'ESRI Shapefile')
```

The `st_read()` / `read_sf()` / `st_write()` / `write_sf()` and `readOGR()`, `writeOGR()`, `readGDAL()`, `writeGDAL()` (used for SpatialGridDataFrame) functions have many arguments, so it is worth spending some time reviewing the associated manual pages.

### Interactive mapping with `mapview` and `leaflet`

The `mapview` and `leaflet` packages make it possible to display interactive maps of `sf` objects in RStudio viewer pane, or within an HTML document generated via R Markdown (e.g. this document).

* [`mapview` package](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview)
   - [Basics](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/articles/articles/mapview_01-basics.html)
   - [Advanced Features](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/articles/articles/mapview_02-advanced.html)
   - See other "Articles" in this series, you can make [complex, interactive maps](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/articles/articles/mapview_05-extras.html) using the `mapview` package.
* [`leaflet` package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
* [`leafem`: 'leaflet' Extensions for 'mapview'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leafem/index.html)

The `seriesExtent` function in `soilDB` returns an `sf` object showing generalized extent polygons for a given soil series.

```{r, results='asis', eval=TRUE, out.width="100%"}
# load required packages, just in case
library(soilDB)
library(sf)
library(mapview)

# series extents from SoilWeb (sf objects)
pentz <- seriesExtent('pentz')
amador <- seriesExtent('amador')

# combine into a single object
s <- rbind(pentz, amador)

# colors used in the map
# add more colors as needed
cols <- c('royalblue', 'firebrick')

# make a simple map, colors set by 'series' column
mapview(s, zcol = 'series', col.regions = cols, legend = TRUE)
```

#### EXERCISE 2: Map your favorite soil series extents

The following code demonstrates how to fetch / convert / map soil series extents, using a vector of soil series names. Results appear in the RStudio "Viewer" pane. Be sure to try the "Export" and "show in window" (next to the broom icon) buttons.

```{r, results='asis', eval=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# load required packages, just in case
library(soilDB)
library(sf)
library(mapview)

# vector of series names, letter case does not matter
# try several (2-9)!
series.names <- c('auberry', 'sierra', 'holland', 'cagwin')

# iterate over series names, get extent
# result is a list of sf objects
s <- lapply(series.names, soilDB::seriesExtent)

# flatten list -> single sf object
s <- do.call('rbind', s)

# colors used in the map
# note trick used to dynamically set the number of colors
cols <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = length(series.names), name = 'Set1')

# make a simple map, colors set by 'series' column
# click on polygons for details
# try pop-out / export buttons
mapview(s, zcol = 'series', col.regions = cols, legend = TRUE)
```

### The `terra` Package

The [`terra` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html) package provides most of the commonly used grid and vector processing functionality that one might find in a conventional GIS. It provides high-level data structures and functions for the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library).
  
 * re-sampling / interpolation
 * projection and warping (coordinate system transformations of gridded data)
 * cropping, mosaicing, masking
 * local and focal functions
 * raster algebra
 * contouring
 * raster/vector conversions
 * terrain analysis
 * model-based prediction (more on this in Part 2)

#### Other approaches to raster data

##### `raster`

A more complete background on the capabilities of the `raster` package, and the replacement [`terra`](https://rspatial.org/terra/index.html), are described in the [*Spatial Data Science with R*](http://rspatial.org/) online book.

[*Introduction to the raster package*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf) vignette 

##### `stars`

There is also a package called [`stars`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) (Spatiotemporal Arrays: Raster and Vector Datacubes) that is the `sf`-centric way of dealing with higher dimensional raster and vector "datacubes." Data cubes have dimensions related to time, spectral band, and sensor. The `stars` data structures are often used for processing satellite data sources.
  
#### Importing / Exporting Rasters

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, eval=TRUE}
# use an example from the raster package
f <- system.file("external/test.grd", package = "raster")

# create a reference to this raster
r <- raster(f)

# equivalent terra code
r2 <- terra::rast(f)

# show RasterLayer details
print(r)

# show SpatRaster details
print(r2) 

# default plot method
plot(r)
```

The R object only stores a reference to the data until they are needed to be loaded into memory. This allows for internal raster manipulation algorithms to intelligently deal with very large grids that may not fit in memory.

### Converting Vector to Raster

#### [`raster::rasterize()`](https://rspatial.github.io/raster/reference/rasterize.html)

#### [`fasterize::fasterize()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/fasterize/versions/1.0.3/topics/fasterize)


## Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

Spatial data aren't all that useful without an accurate description of the Coordinate Reference System (CRS). This type of information is typically stored within the ".prj" component of a shapefile, or in the header of a GeoTIFF. 

Without a CRS it is not possible to perform coordinate transformations (e.g. conversion of geographic coordinates to projected coordinates), spatial overlay (e.g. intersection), or geometric calculations (e.g. distance or area).

The "old" way (PROJ.4) of specifying coordinate reference systems is using character strings containing, for example: `+proj` or `+init` arguments. In general, this still "works," so you may encounter it and need to know about it. But you also may encounter cases where CRS are specified using integers, strings of the form `authority:code`, or well-known text (WKT).

Some common examples of coordinate system "EPSG" codes and their legacy "PROJ.4" strings. 4

 - "EPSG" stands for European Petroleum Survey Group. The "EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset" is a public registry of geodetic datums, spatial reference systems, Earth ellipsoids, coordinate transformations and related units of measurement. 
 
 - "OGC" refers to the Open Geospatial Consortium, which is an example of another important `authority:code`. "ESRI" (company that develops ArcGIS) also defines many CRS codes. 
 
 - "PROJ" is the software responsible for transforming coordinates from one CRS to another. The current version of PROJ available is 9, and in PROJ > 6 major changes were made to the way that coordinate reference systems are defined and transformed led to the "PROJ.4" syntax falling out of favor.

 * _EPSG_: [`4326`](https://epsg.io/4326) / _PROJ.4_:`+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84` - geographic, WGS84 datum (NASIS Standard)
 * _OGC_:[`CRS84`](http://defs.opengis.net/vocprez/object?uri=http://www.opengis.net/def/ogc/CRS84) - geographic, WGS84 datum (same as above but explicit longitude, latitude XY order)
 * _EPSG_: [`4269`](https://epsg.io/4269) / _PROJ.4_:`+proj=longlat +datum=NAD83` - geographic, NAD83 datum
 * _EPSG_: [`4267`](https://epsg.io/4267) / _PROJ.4_:`+proj=longlat +datum=NAD27` - geographic, NAD27 datum
 * _EPSG_: [`26910`](https://epsg.io/26910) / _PROJ.4_:`+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=NAD83` - projected (UTM zone 10), NAD83 datum
 * _EPSG_: [`5070`](https://epsg.io/5070) / _PROJ.4_: `+proj=aea +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +lat_0=23.0 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs` - Albers Equal Area CONUS (gSSURGO)
 
 - More on the EPSG codes and specifics of CRS definitions:
 
   - https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/
   
   - https://epsg.io/
 
While you may encounter PROJ.4 strings, these are no longer considered the preferred method of referencing Coordinate Reference Systems -- and, in general, newer methods are "easier."

Well-known text (WKT) is a human- machine-readable standard format for geometry, so storing the Coordinate Reference System information in a similar format makes sense. This format is returned by the `sf::st_crs` method. 

For example: the WKT representation of `EPSG:4326`: 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
st_crs(4326)
```

This is using the [OGC WKT CRS standard](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wkt-crs). Adoption of this standard caused some significant changes in packages in the R ecosystem. 

So you can get familiar, what follows are several examples of doing the same thing: setting the CRS of spatial objects with WGS84 longitude/latitude geographic coordinates. If you have another target coordinate system, it is just a matter of using the correct codes to identify it.

### Assigning and Transforming Coordinate Systems

Returning to the example from above, lets **assign** a CRS to our series extent `s` using different methods.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
s <- seriesExtent('san joaquin')
```

The following are equivalent `sf` versus `sp` vs. `rgdal` syntax. 

#### `sf`

Use `st_crs<-` to set, or `st_crs` get CRS of `sf` objects. Supply the target EPSG code as an integer.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# s is an sp object, we convert it to sf with st_as_sf
s <- st_as_sf(s) 

# the CRS of s is EPSG:4326
st_crs(s) == st_crs(4326)

# set CRS using st_crs<- (replace with identical value)
st_crs(s) <- st_crs(4326)
```

Transformation of points, lines, and polygons with `sf` requires an “origin” CRS be defined in the argument `x`. The “target” CRS is defined as an integer (EPSG code) in the `crs` argument or is the output of `st_crs()`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# transform to UTM zone 10
s.utm <- st_transform(x = s, crs = 26910)

# transform to GCS NAD27
s.nad27 <- st_transform(x = s, crs = st_crs(4267))
```

#### `sp` and `rgdal`

You can do the same thing several different ways with `sp` objects. An equivalent EPSG, OGC and PROJ.4 can be set or get using `proj4string<-`/`proj4string` and either a `sp` `CRS` object or a PROJ.4 string for `Spatial` objects.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# s is an sf object (we converted it), convert back to Spatial* object
s.sp <- sf::as_Spatial(s) 

# these all create the same internal sp::CRS object
proj4string(s.sp) <- sp::CRS('EPSG:4326')          # proj >6; EPSG
proj4string(s.sp) <- sp::CRS('OGC:CRS84')          # proj >6; OGC
proj4string(s.sp) <- '+init=epsg:4326'             # proj4 style +init string
proj4string(s.sp) <- '+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84'  # proj4 style +proj string
```

Here, we do the same transformations we did above only using `sp`: `spTransform()`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# transform to UTM zone 10
s.utm <- spTransform(s.sp, CRS('+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=NAD83'))

# transform to GCS NAD27
s.nad27 <- spTransform(s.sp, CRS('+proj=longlat +datum=NAD27'))
```

#### `terra` and `raster`

Use `crs<-` and `crs` for `raster`, `terra` or `sp` `CRS` objects.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# r is a raster object; set CRS as the CRS of itself
crs(r) <- raster::crs(sp::CRS(r))
```

"Transforming" or "warping" a raster is a different from with a vector as it requires interpolation of pixels to a target resolution and CRS. 

The method provided by `terra` is `project()` and in `raster` it is `projectRaster()`. 

It works the same as the above "transform" methods in that you specify an object to transform, and the target reference system or a template for the object. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t.wgs84 <- terra::project(terra::rast(r), terra::crs("EPSG:4326"))
r.wgs84 <- projectRaster(r, CRS("EPSG:4326"))
```

Note that the default warping of raster uses _bilinear interpolation_ (`method='bilinear'`), which is appropriate for _continuous variables_. 

You also have the option of using nearest-neighbor (`method='ngb'`) for _categorical variables_ (class maps) where interpolation would not make sense.

If we want to save this transformed raster to file, we can use something like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
writeRaster(r.wgs84, filename='r_wgs84.tif', options=c("COMPRESS=LZW"))
```

## Raster data

### Object Properties

`RasterLayer` and `SpatRaster` objects are similar to `sf`, `sp` and other R spatial objects in that they keep track of the linkages between data, coordinate reference system, and optional attribute tables. Getting and setting the contents of raster objects should be performed using functions such as:
  
* `raster::NAvalue(r)` / `terra::NAflag(r)`: get / set the NODATA value
* `raster::wkt(r)` OR `terra::crs(r)`: get / set the coordinate reference system
* `res(r)`: get / set the resolution
* `raster::extent(r)` or `terra::ext(r)`: get / set the extent
* `raster::dataType(r)` / `terra::datatype(r)`: get / set the data type
* ... many more, see the [`raster`](https://rspatial.github.io/raster/) and [`terra`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/) package manuals

### Rasters "In Memory" v.s. "File-Based"

Processing of raster data in memory is always faster than processing on disk, as long as there is sufficient memory. The `terra` package handles basically all of the logic delegating in v.s. out of memory processing internally--so it is rare that any adjustments to defaults are required.

With the `raster` package, the initial file/disk-based reference can be converted to an in-memory `RasterLayer` with the `readAll()` function. You can achieve a similar effect in `terra` by doing `set.values(object)`.

### Writing Rasters to File

Exporting data requires consideration of the output format, datatype, encoding of NODATA, and other options such as compression. 

See the manual pages for `writeRaster()`, `writeFormats()`, and `dataType()` for details. For example, suppose you had a `RasterLayer` object that you wanted to save to disk as an internally-compressed GeoTIFF:
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
# using previous example data set
raster::writeRaster(r, filename = 'r.tif', options = c("COMPRESS=LZW"))
```

With terra, "LZW" compression is used by default when writing GeoTIFF files. Using the `gdal` argument e.g.: `terra::writeRaster(..., gdal=)` is equivalent to specifying `option` argument to `raster::writeRaster()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# using previous example data set
terra::writeRaster(t.wgs84, filename = 't.wgs84.tif')
```

The `writeRaster()` function interprets the given (and missing) arguments as:
  
* '.tif' suffix interpreted as `format=GTiff`
* creation options of "LZW compression" passed to GeoTiff driver
* default `datatype`
* default `NAflag`

### Data Types

Commonly used raster `datatype` include: "unsigned integer", "signed integer", and "floating point" of variable precision.

 * `INT1U`: integers from 0 to 255
 * `INT2U`: integers from 0 to 65,534
 * `INT2S`: integers from -32,767 to 32,767
 * `INT4S`: integers from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647
 * `FLT4S`: floating point from -3.4e+38 to 3.4e+38
 * `FLT8S`: floating point from -1.7e+308 to 1.7e+308

It is wise to manually specify an output `datatype` that will "just fit" the required precision. 

For example, if you have generated a `RasterLayer` that warrants integer precision and ranges from 0 to 100, then the `INT1U` data type would provide enough precision to store all possible values *and* the NODATA value. Raster data stored as integers will always be smaller (sometimes 10-100x) than those stored as floating point, especially when internal compression is enabled.

```{eval = FALSE}
# integer grid with a range of 0-100
# maybe soil texture classes
raster::writeRaster(r, filename = 'r.tif', datatype = 'INT1U')

# floating point grid with very wide range
# maybe DSM soil property model output
terra::writeRaster(t.wgs84, filename = 'r.tif', datatype = 'FLT4S')
```

#### Notes on Compression

It is often a good idea to create internally-compressed raster data. 

The [GeoTiff format](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gtiff.html) can accommodate many different compression algorithms, including lossy (JPEG) compression. Usually, the default "LZW" or "DEFLATE" compression will result in significant savings, especially for data encoded as integers. 

For example, the CONUS gSSURGO map unit key grid at 30m resolution is about 55Gb (GeoTiff, no compression) vs. 2.4Gb after LZW compression.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# reasonable compression using LZW is the default, compare to 

raster::writeRaster(r, filename='r.tif', options=c("COMPRESS=NONE"))

# takes longer to write the file, but better compression
terra::writeRaster(t.wgs84, filename='r.tif', gdal=c("COMPRESS=DEFLATE", "PREDICTOR=2", "ZLEVEL=9")
```

See [this article](https://kokoalberti.com/articles/geotiff-compression-optimization-guide/) for some ideas on optimization of file read/write times and associated compressed file sizes.  



## Spatial Overlay Operations

Spatial data are lot more useful when "combined" (overlay, intersect, spatial query, etc.) to generate something new. For simplicity, we will refer to this kind of operation as an "extraction". The CRS of the two objects being overlaid must match.

### Vector Data

```{r}
p <- sf::st_as_sf(data.frame(x = -120, y = 37.5),
                  coords = c("x", "y"),
                  crs = 4326)
```

In `sf` the functions used to do this are `st_intersects()` or `st_intersection()`.

```{r}
st_intersection(p, <Simple Features>)
```

In `sp` objects, you do these operations with the `sp::over()` function. Access the associated vignette by pasting `vignette("over")` in the console when the `sp` package is loaded.

```{r}
# hand make a SpatialPoints object
# note that this is GCS
p <- SpatialPoints(coords = cbind(-120, 37.5), 
                   proj4string = CRS('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84'))

# spatial extraction of MLRA data requires a CRS transformation
p.aea <- spTransform(p, proj4string(mlra))
over(p.aea, mlra)
```

### Spatial Data Extraction

#### Load Required Packages

Load required packages into a fresh RStudio Session (Ctrl + Shift + F10)

```{r results="hide"}
library(aqp)
library(soilDB)
library(sf)
library(terra)
```

#### Download Example Data

Run the following to create a path for the example data. Be sure to set a valid path to a local disk.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# store path as a variable, in case you want to keep it somewhere else
ch4.data.path <- 'C:/workspace2/chapter-4'

# make a place to store chapter 2b example data
dir.create(ch4.data.path, recursive = TRUE)

# download polygon example data from github
download.file(
  'https://github.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/raw/master/data/chapter_4-spatial-data/chapter-4-mu-polygons.zip', 
  file.path(ch4.data.path, 'chapter-4-mu-polygons.zip')
)

# download raster example data from github 
download.file(
  'https://github.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/raw/master/data/chapter_4-spatial-data/chapter-4-PRISM.zip', 
  file.path(ch4.data.path, 'chapter-4-PRISM.zip')
)

# unzip
unzip(
  file.path(ch4.data.path, 'chapter-4-mu-polygons.zip'), 
  exdir = ch4.data.path, overwrite = TRUE
)

unzip(
  file.path(ch4.data.path, 'chapter-4-PRISM.zip'), 
  exdir = ch4.data.path, overwrite = TRUE
)
```

#### Load Sample MLRA Data

We will be using polygons associated with MLRA 15 and 18 as part of this demonstration. 

Import these data  with `sf::st_read()`.

```{r results='hide', eval=TRUE} 
# load MLRA polygons
mlra <- sf::st_read(file.path(ch4.data.path, 'mlra-18-15-AEA.shp'))
```

We will load the sample raster data (PRISM derived) using `raster::raster()`

```{r results='hide', eval=TRUE} 
# mean annual air temperature, Deg C
maat <- raster::raster(file.path(ch4.data.path, 'MAAT.tif'))

# mean annual precipitation, mm
map <- raster::raster(file.path(ch4.data.path, 'MAP.tif'))

# frost-free days
ffd <- raster::raster(file.path(ch4.data.path, 'FFD.tif'))

# growing degree days
gdd <- raster::raster(file.path(ch4.data.path, 'GDD.tif'))

# percent of annual PPT as rain
rain_fraction <- raster::raster(file.path(ch4.data.path, 'rain_fraction.tif'))

# annual sum of monthly PPT - ET_p
ppt_eff <- raster::raster(file.path(ch4.data.path, 'effective_precipitation.tif'))
```

Sometimes it is convenient to "stack" raster data that share a common grid size, extent, and coordinate reference system into a multilayer `terra` `SpatRaster` object. Calling `terra::rast()` on a `list` of `SpatRaster` is equivalent to making a `RasterStack` from several `RasterLayer`s with `raster::stack()`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# create a raster stack (multiple rasters aligned)
rs <- raster::stack(maat, map, ffd, gdd, rain_fraction, ppt_eff) 

rs
plot(rs)
```

### Approach

Typically, spatial queries of raster data by polygon features are performed in two ways:
  
 1. for each polygon, collect all pixels that overlap (`exactextractr` approach)
 
 2. for each polygon, collect a sample of pixels defined by [sampling points](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/sharpshootR/sample-vs-population.html)

The first method ensures that all data are included in the analysis, however, processing can be slow for multiple/detailed rasters, and the results may not fit into memory. 

The second method is more efficient (10-100x faster), requires less memory, and can remain statistically sound--as long as a reasonable sampling strategy is applied. Sampling may also help you avoid low-acreage "anomalies" in the raster product. More on sampling methods in the next chapter. 

The `extract()` function can perform several operations in one call, such as buffering (in projected units) with `buffer` argument. See the manual page for an extensive listing of optional arguments and what they do.

Sampling and extraction with `raster` methods results in a `matrix` object. Sampling and extraction with `terra` the results in a `SpatVector` object.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# sampling single RasterLayer -> SpatRaster
terra::spatSample(terra::rast(maat), size = 10)

# sampling RasterStack -> SpatRaster
terra::spatSample(terra::rast(rs), size = 10)
```


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5, eval=TRUE}
par(mfcol = c(1, 2), mar = c(1, 1, 3, 1))

# regular sampling + extraction of raster values
x.regular <-  terra::spatSample(
  terra::rast(maat),
  method = "regular",
  size = 100,
  as.points = TRUE
)
x.regular

# see also raster::sampleRegular()

plot(maat,
     axes = FALSE,
     legend = FALSE,
     main = 'Regular Sampling')
points(x.regular)

# random sample + extraction of raster values
# note that NULL values are removed
x.random <- terra::spatSample(
  terra::rast(maat),
  size = 100,
  as.points = TRUE,
  na.rm = TRUE
)

# see also raster::sampleRandom()

plot(maat,
     axes = FALSE,
     legend = FALSE,
     main = 'Random Sampling with NA Removal')
points(x.random)
```

Note that the mean can be efficiently estimated, even with a relatively small number of samples.

```{r}
# all values: slow for large grids
mean(raster::values(maat), na.rm = TRUE)

# regular sampling: efficient, central tendency comparable to above
mean(x.regular$MAAT, na.rm = TRUE)

# this value will be pseudorandom
#  depends on number of samples, pattern of NA
mean(x.random$MAAT, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Just how much variation can we expect when collecting 100, randomly-located samples over such a large area? 

```{r}
# 10 replications of samples of n=100
z <- replicate(10, {
  mean(terra::spatSample(terra::rast(maat),
                         size = 100,
                         na.rm = TRUE)$MAAT,
       na.rm = TRUE)
})

# 90% of the time the mean MAAT values were within:
quantile(z, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))
```

Do the above routine 100 times: compute the mean MAAT from 100 randomly-located samples. Does it make a difference in your estimates?

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=6.75, eval=TRUE}
# MLRA polygons in native coordinate system
plot(sf::st_geometry(mlra), main = 'MLRA 15 and 18')
box()

# MAAT raster
plot(maat, main = 'PRISM Mean Annual Air Temperature (deg C)')

# plot MAAT raster with MLRA polygons on top
# this requires transforming to CRS of MAAT
mlra.gcs <- sf::st_transform(mlra, sf::st_crs(maat))
plot(maat, main = 'PRISM Mean Annual Air Temperature (deg C)')
plot(sf::st_geometry(mlra.gcs), main = 'MLRA 15 and 18', add = TRUE)
```

#### Extracting Raster Data: KSSL Pedon Locations

Extract PRISM data at the coordinates associated with KSSL pedons that have been correlated to the [AUBURN](https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/sde/?series=auburn) series. 

We will use the [`fetchKSSL()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/KSSL-demo.html) function from the `soilDB` package to get KSSL data from the most recent snapshot. This example can be easily adapted to pedon data extracted from NASIS using [`fetchNASIS()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/fetchNASIS-mini-tutorial.html).

Get some KSSL data and upgrade the "site" data to a `sf` object.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# result is a SoilProfileCollection object
auburn <- soilDB::fetchKSSL(series = 'auburn')

# extract site data
s <-  sf::st_as_sf(aqp::site(auburn),
                   coords = c("x", "y"),
                   crs = 4326)
```

Extract PRISM data (the `SpatRaster` object we made earlier) at the Auburn KSSL locations and summarize.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# convert sf object s to terra SpatVector, and pass to terra::extract()
e <- terra::extract(terra::rast(rs), terra::vect(s), df = TRUE)

# summarize: remove first (ID) column using [, -1] j index
summary(e[, -1])
```

Join the extracted PRISM data with the original `SoilProfileCollection` object. 

More information on [`SoilProfileCollection objects here`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/aqp/aqp-intro.html).

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# combine site data (sf) with extracted raster values (data.frame), row-order is identical, result is sf
res <- cbind(s, e)

# extract unique IDs and PRISM data; dplyr verbs work with sf data.frames
res2 <- dplyr::select(res, pedon_key, MAAT, MAP, FFD, GDD, rain_fraction, effective_precipitation)

# join with original SoilProfileCollection object via pedon_key
site(auburn) <- res2
```

The extracted values are now part of the "auburn" `SoilProfileCollection` object via `site(<SoilProfileCollection>) <- data.frame` LEFT JOIN method.

Does there appear to be a relationship between soil morphology and "effective precipitation"?

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=6.5, eval=TRUE}
# create an ordering of pedons based on the extracted effective PPT
new.order <- order(auburn$effective_precipitation)

# setup figure margins, 1x1 row*column layout
par(mar = c(4.5, 0, 4, 0), mfcol = c(1, 1))

# plot profile sketches
plotSPC(auburn,
        name = 'hzn_desgn',
        print.id = FALSE,
        color = 'clay',
        plot.order = new.order,
        cex.names = 0.75,
        max.depth = 70,
        width = 0.3,
        name.style = 'center-top',
        scaling.factor = 1,
        plot.depth.axis = FALSE,
        hz.depths = TRUE
)

# add an axis with extracted raster values
axis(side = 1,
     at = 1:length(auburn),
     labels = round(auburn$effective_precipitation[new.order]),
     cex.axis = 0.75)

mtext('Annual Sum of Monthly (PPT - ET_p) (mm)',
      side = 1,
      line = 2.5)
```

Note that negative values are associated with a net deficit in monthly precipitation vs. estimated ET.

#### Raster Summary By Polygon: Series Extent

The [`seriesExtent()`](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/series-extent.html) function from the `soilDB` package provides a simple interface to [Series Extent Explorer](https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/see/) data files. 

Note that these series extents have been generalized for rapid display at regional to continental scales. A more precise representation of "series extent" can be generated from SSURGO polygons and queried from [SDA](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/SDA-tutorial-2.html).

Get an approximate extent for the [Amador](http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/sde/?series=amador) soil series from [SEE](https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/see/#amador). See the `seriesExtent` [tutorial](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/series-extent.html) and [manual page](http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/reference/seriesExtent.html) for additional options and related functions.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# get (generalized) amador soil series extent from SoilWeb
amador <- soilDB::seriesExtent(s = 'amador')

# convert to EPSG:5070 Albers Equal Area
amador <- sf::st_transform(sf::st_as_sf(amador), 5070)
```

Generate 100 sampling points within the extent using a hexagonal grid. These point locations will be used to extract raster values from our `SpatRaster` of PRISM data. Note that using a "hexagonal" grid is not supported on geographic coordinates.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
samples <- sf::st_sample(amador, size = 100, type = 'hexagonal')
```

For comparison, extract a single point from each SSURGO map unit delineation that contains *Amador* as a major component. This will require a query to SDA for the set of matching map unit keys (`mukey`), followed by a second request to SDA for the geometry.

The `SDA_query` function is used to send arbitrary queries written in SQL to SDA, the results may be a `data.frame` or `list`, depending on the complexity of the query. The `fetchSDA_spatial` function returns map unit geometry as either polygons, polygon envelopes, or a single point within each polygon as selected by `mukey` or `nationalmusym`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# result is a data.frame
mukeys <- soilDB::SDA_query("SELECT DISTINCT mukey FROM component
                             WHERE compname = 'Amador' AND majcompflag = 'Yes';")

# result is a SpatialPointsDataFrame
amador.pts <- soilDB::fetchSDA_spatial(
  mukeys$mukey,
  by.col = 'mukey',
  method = 'point',
  chunk.size = 2
)

amador.pts <- sf::st_as_sf(amador.pts)
```

Graphically check both methods:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# prepare samples and mapunit points for viewing on PRISM data
hexagonal <- sf::st_transform(samples, sf::st_crs(maat))
amador_gcs <- sf::st_transform(amador, sf::st_crs(maat))
maatcrop <- terra::crop(maat, amador_gcs)
```

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=7, eval=TRUE}
# adjust margins and setup plot device for two columns
par(mar = c(1, 1, 3, 1), mfcol = c(1, 2))

# first figure
plot(maatcrop,
     main = 'PRISM MAAT\n100 Sampling Points from Extent',
     axes = FALSE)
plot(sf::st_geometry(amador_gcs), add = TRUE)
plot(hexagonal, cex = 0.25, add = T)

plot(maatcrop,
     main = 'PRISM MAAT\nPolygon Centroids',
     axes = FALSE)
plot(sf::st_geometry(amador.pts), cex = 0.25, add = TRUE)
```

Extract PRISM data (the `RasterStack` object we made earlier) at the sampling locations (100 regularly-spaced and from MU polygon centroids) and summarize. Note that CRS transformations are automatic (when possible), with a warning.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# return the result as a data.frame object
e <- raster::extract(rs, sf::as_Spatial(hexagonal), df = TRUE)
e.pts <- raster::extract(rs, sf::as_Spatial(amador.pts), df = TRUE)

# check out the extracted data
summary(e[,-1])

# all pair-wise correlations, note NAs -> why?
knitr::kable(cor(e[,-1]), digits = 2)

# only 1 unique value, correlation is impossible to compute
unique(e$rain_fraction)
```

Quickly compare the two sets of samples. 

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=4, eval=TRUE}
# compile results into a list
maat.comparison <- list('regular samples' = e$MAAT,
                        'polygon centroids' = e.pts$MAAT)

# number of samples per method
lapply(maat.comparison, length)

# summary() applied by group
lapply(maat.comparison, summary)

# box-whisker plot
par(mar = c(4.5, 8, 3, 1), mfcol = c(1, 1))
boxplot(
  maat.comparison,
  horizontal = TRUE,
  las = 1,
  xlab = 'MAAT (deg C)',
  varwidth = TRUE,
  boxwex = 0.5,
  main = 'MAAT Comparison'
)
```

Basic climate summaries from a standardized source (e.g. PRISM) might be a useful addition to an OSD.

Think about how you could adapt this example to compare climate summaries derived from NASIS pedons to summaries derived from map unit polygons and generalized soil series extents.

#### Raster Summary By Polygon: MLRA 

The following example is a simplified version of what is available in the [`soilReports`](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilReports) package, reports on the [ncss-tech](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soil-pit/tree/master/reports) GitHub repository, or in the [TEUI suite of map unit summary tools](https://www.fs.fed.us/eng/rsac/programs/teui/about.html). 

<!-- The [*Computing GIS Summaries from Map Unit Polygons*](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/sharpshootR/GIS-summary-by-MU.html) tutorial is an expanded version of this example. -->

Example output from the `soilReports` package:
  
  * [summary of select CA630 map units](http://ncss-tech.github.io/example-reports/mu-comparison/CA630-mu-comparison.html)
  * [summary of select MLRA polygons](http://ncss-tech.github.io/example-reports/mu-comparison/MLRA-comparison-report.html)

Efficient summary of large raster data sources can be accomplished using:

  * internally-compressed raster data sources, stored on a local disk, can be in any coordinate system
  * polygons stored in an equal-area or UTM coordinate system, with CRS units of meters
  * [fixed-density sampling](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/sharpshootR/sample-vs-population.html) of polygons
  * estimation of quantiles from collected raster samples

Back to our example data. The first step is to check the MLRA polygons (`mlra`); how many features per MLRA symbol? Note that some MLRA have more than one polygon.

```{r}
table(mlra$MLRARSYM)
```

Convert polygon area from square meters to acres and summarize. Note that this will only make sense when using a projected CRS with units of meters (equal area)!

```{r}
poly.area <- terra::expanse(terra::vect(mlra)) / 4046.86 

sf::sf_use_s2(TRUE)
poly.area.s2 <- units::set_units(x = sf::st_area(mlra), value = "acre")

sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)
poly.area.sf <- units::set_units(x = sf::st_area(mlra), value = "acre")

summary(poly.area)

sum(poly.area)
sum(poly.area.s2)
sum(poly.area.sf)
```

Sample each polygon at a constant sampling density of `0.001` samples per acre (1 sample for every 1,000 ac.). At this sampling density we should expect approximately 16,700 samples--more than enough for our simple example.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
library(sharpshootR)

# the next function requires a polygon ID: 
#  each polygon gets a unique number 1--number of polygons
mlra$pID <- 1:nrow(mlra)
cds <- constantDensitySampling(mlra, n.pts.per.ac = 0.001)
```

Extract MLRA symbol at sample points using the `over()` function. The result will be a `data.frame` object with all attributes from our MLRA polygons that intersect sampling points `s`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# spatial overlay: sampling points and MLRA polygons
res <- sf::st_intersection(sf::st_transform(sf::st_as_sf(cds), sf::st_crs(mlra)), mlra)

# row / feature order is preserved, so we can directly copy
cds$mlra <- res$MLRARSYM

# tabulate number of samples per MLRA
table(cds$mlra)
```

Extract values from the `SpatVector` of PRISM data as a `data.frame`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
trs <- terra::rast(rs)
e <- terra::extract(trs, terra::project(cds, terra::crs(trs)))

# join columns from extracted values and sampling points
s.df <- cbind(as(cds, 'data.frame'), e)

# check results
head(s.df)
```

Summarizing multivariate data by group (MLRA) is usually much simpler after reshaping data from "wide" to "long" format.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# reshape from wide to long format
m <- tidyr::pivot_longer(s.df, cols = c(MAAT, MAP, FFD, GDD, rain_fraction, effective_precipitation))

# check "wide" format
head(m)
```

A tabular summary of means by MLRA and PRISM variable using `dplyr` v.s. `base` `tapply()`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# tabular summary of mean values
dplyr::group_by(m, mlra, name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(mean(value)) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(name)

# base R
tapply(m$value, list(m$mlra, m$name), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

#### Faster with `exactextractr`

This example shows how to determine the distribution of Frost-Free Days across a soil series extent.

The data are extracted from the raster data source very rapidly using the `exactextractr` package.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=5, results='hide', eval=TRUE}
library(sf)
library(soilDB)
library(terra)
library(lattice)
library(exactextractr)

# 5-10 seconds to download Series Extent Explorer data 
series <- c('holland', 'san joaquin')

# make SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
s <- do.call('rbind', lapply(series, seriesExtent))

# load pointer to PRISM data
r <- rast('C:/workspace2/chapter-4/FFD.tif')

# transform extent to CRS of raster with sf
s <- st_transform(st_as_sf(s), crs = st_crs(r))

# inspect
s

# use `st_union(s)` to create a MULTI- POINT/LINE/POLYGON from single
# use `sf::st_cast(s, 'POLYGON')` to create other types

system.time({ ex <- exactextractr::exact_extract(r, s) })

# ex is a list(), with data.frame [value, coverage_fraction]
#  for each polygon in s (we have one MULTIPOLYGON per series)

# combine all list elements `ex` into single data.frame `ex.all`
#  - use do.call('rbind', ...) to stack data.frames row-wise
#  - an anonymous function that iterates along length of `ex`
#  - adding the series name to as a new variable, calculated using `i`
ex.all <- do.call('rbind', lapply(seq_along(ex), function(i) {
  cbind(data.frame(group = series[i]), ex[[i]])
}))

# simple summary
densityplot(~ value | group, data = ex.all, 
            plot.points = FALSE, bw = 2, lwd = 2,
            strip = strip.custom(bg = grey(0.85)),
            scales = list(alternating = 1),
            col = c('RoyalBlue'), layout = c(1, 2),
            ylab = 'Density', from = 0, to = 400,
            xlab = 'Frost-Free Days (50% chance)\n800m PRISM Data (1981-2010)', 
            main = 'FFD Estimate for Extent of San Joaquin and Holland Series'
)
```

#### Summarizing MLRA Raster Data with `lattice` graphics

Lattice graphics are useful for summarizing grouped comparisons. 

The syntax is difficult to learn and remember, but there is a lot of [documentation online](http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html). 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, eval=TRUE}
library(lattice)

tps <- list(
    box.rectangle = list(col = 'black'),
    box.umbrella = list(col = 'black', lty = 1),
    box.dot = list(cex = 0.75),
    plot.symbol = list(
      col = rgb(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, alpha = 0.25, maxColorValue = 1),
      cex = 0.25
    )
  )

bwplot(mlra ~ value | name, data = m,                   # setup plot and data source
       as.table=TRUE,                                   # start panels in top/left corner
       varwidth=TRUE,                                   # scale width of box by number of obs
       scales=list(alternating=3, relation='free'),     # setup scales
       strip=strip.custom(bg=grey(0.9)),                # styling for strips
       par.settings=tps,                                # apply box/line/point styling
       panel=function(...) {                            # within in panel, do the following
          panel.grid(-1, -1)                            # make grid lines at all tick marks
          panel.bwplot(...)                             # make box-whisker plot
      }
)
```

##### Interactive Summaries

Static figures are a good start, but sometimes an interactive summary is more appropriate for EDA.

The `histboxp` function from the `Hmisc` package creates interactive (HTML) chunks that can be used in RStudio, or embedded in RMarkdown documents (e.g. these notes or `soilReports`). Use the mouse to hover over, click, drag, etc. to interact with the data. Double-click to reset the plot.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
library(Hmisc)

# interactive exploration of the MAAT distributions by MLRA
histboxp(
  x = s.df$MAAT,
  group = s.df$mlra,
  bins = 100,
  xlab = 'Mean Annual Air Temperature (deg C)'
)

# interactive exploration of the Effective PPT distributions by MLRA
histboxp(
  x = s.df$eff.PPT,
  group = s.df$mlra,
  bins = 100,
  xlab = 'Annual Sum of Monthly PPT - PET (mm)'
)
```
